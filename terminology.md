## General Terms

180&deg; card
: A card the opens flat (See [Thanksgiving Turkey](/2021/10/30/thanksgiving-turkey.html))

90&deg; card
: A card the opens only to 90&deg;s. (See [Mars Rover](/2021/03/28/mars-rover.html))

Zero&deg; card
: A card where the design is created by layers of paper that can be opened one at a time. No 3D mechanism is involved. (See [2021 Christmas card](/2021/11/14/christmas.html))

## Mechanisms

These tables briefly describe the basic pop-up mechanisms used for about every pop-up you'll see in cards and books. The columns in the tables refer to the following books. Click on the link for my reviews.
