## General Terms

180&deg; card
: A card the opens flat (See [Thankgiving Turkey](/2021/10/30/thanksgiving-turkey.html))

90&deg; card
: A card the opens only to 90&deg;s. (See [Mars Rover](/2021/03/28/mars-rover.html))

Zero&deg; card
: A card where the design is created by layers of paper that can be opened one at a time. No 3D mechanism is involved. (2021 Christmas card coming in December)

## Mechanisms

This table briefly describes the basic pop-up mechanisms used for about every pop-up you'll see using terminology from [Pop-Up Design and Paper Mechanics: How to Make Folding Paper Sculpture](/books.html#pop-up-design-and-paper-mechanics-how-to-make-folding-paper-sculpture), one of my favorite books. `BH2` refers the the number in that book. `BH1` refers to his earlier book, [Pop Up!: A Manual of Paper Mechanisms](/books.html#pop-up-a-manual-of-paper-mechanisms)

### Foundation Shapes

| Name                     | BH2  | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Right-angle V Fold       | FS1  | Basic of mechanisms that stands vertically and usually opens away from the viewer.                                             |
| Acute-angle V Fold       | FS2  | Most common an versatile of mechanisms that form a V shape opening away or towards the viewer.                                 |
| Pointed V Fold           | FS3  | Similar to FS2, but very pointed.                                                                                              |
| Obtuse-angle V Fold      | FS4  | A V fold with obtuse angle.                                                                                                    |
| Asymmetric V Fold        | FS5  | A V with different angles. These make popups a bit more interesting.                                                           |
| Parallel Fold            | FS6  | A mechanism with a fold parallel to the main fold to form a triangular shape when opened 180 degrees.                          |
| Parallelogram            | FS7  | Mechanism has folds parallel to the main fold and when opened 90 degrees forms a rectangle.                                    |
| Asymmetric-Parallel Fold | FS8  | Similar to FS6 and FS7, only the sides are the the same length.                                                                |
| Zigzag Fold              | FS9  | Similar to FS1 with additional folds.                                                                                          |
| M Fold                   | FS10 | A V fold with more V folds, this gives you many planes and folds to build upon.                                                |
| Floating Plane           | FS11 | A plan that is parallel to the base when opened 180 degrees.                                                                   |
| Box                      | FS12 | An enclosed box with sides parallel to the main fold.                                                                          |
| Open-topped Box          | FS13 | Similar to FS12, with no lid. Like FS12, it may be circular                                                                    |
| Pyramids                 | FS14 | As the name suggest, a pyramid and variations of it.                                                                           |
| Curved Shapes            | FS15 | Derived from a V or parallel fold, the mechanism pops up with curved sides.                                                    |
| Twisting Mechanism       | FS16 | An interesting mechanism that twists as the page is opened. It also gives you many options for building more mechanisms on it. |
| Automatic Pull-strip     | FS17 | As the page is opened a strip pulls up a half cylinder or parallel shape.                                                      |
| Moving Arms              | FS18 | Always a favorite since the movement can be dramatic as an arm moves when the page is opened.                                  |

### Building Techniques

| Name                | BH2 | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------- | --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cutting Parts Away  | BT1 | Cutting parts of a mechanism can drastically change its shape                             |
| Sticking Pieces On  | BT2 | Adding new pieces on folds created by a mechanism is very common                          |
| Extra Creases       | BT3 | This adds more folds to a mechanism                                                       |
| Angle-folded strips | BT4 | These are added pieces like BT2, but with extra creases                                   |
| Counter folds       | BT5 | Folds cut into or added to a fold. OA is all counter folds                                |
| Slots               | BT6 | With many variations, a slot cut into a mechanism allows another piece to slide in or out |
| Bending Planes      | BT7 | Spirals, 7.1, and flattened gullies, 7.2                                                  |
| Straps              | BT8 | Straps add new folds on the base of a 180&deg; card                                       |
| 45-degree folds     | BT9 | These can lift a vertical piece on a folder, or attach to another mechanism               |
