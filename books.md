Here's a list of my favorite pop-up books. I've grouped them in general topics, but they often have overlaps. Note that all the links are paid, Amazon links.

### Pop-Up Design and Paper Mechanics: How to Make Folding Paper Sculpture

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784945145?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li2&tag=seekatar-20&linkId=9ce0d2fcced465127a04acaaa1c8a59a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1784945145&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=seekatar-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=seekatar-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=1784945145" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

by Duncan Birmingham

For me this is _the_ book on pop-up engineering and I can not recommend it enough. It covers almost every pop-up mechanism I've seen in a well-organized fashion, with clear, color photographs and plenty of examples. Perhaps a bit too technical for some, I enjoy his comments on the theory behind the mechanism, and how adjusting one angle affects another. This is his revised version of his earlier book [below](/books.html#pop-up-a-manual-of-paper-mechanisms).

The last section of the book has patterns for 14 projects to build that cover many of the techniques.

In this blog I will refer to the mechanism with the numbers from this book. For example, Foundation Shape 7, would be FS7 (parallelogram). See the [terminology](/terminology.html) page for details.

by Duncan Birmingham

This is the first Birmingham book, which I also recommend if you can find it. Smaller, and with black-and-white illustrations, it has 120 different mechanism, some with several variations.

As an aspiring paper engineer, I created every one of the popups of this book on 5 1/2 x 4 1/4 (quarter of a sheet of letter) paper.

### The Elements of Pop-Up

by James Diaz, David A. Carter

No longer in print, this one is interesting in that it is itself a pop-up book with examples of many mechanisms. Each little pop-up has a paragraph explaining it with the pop-up itself annotated with notes about angles and dimensions. Other mechanisms such as pull tabs and wheels are also covered. You get to see all the details of a mechanism from cut outs, or being able to see the back of it. In addition to the working samples and directions, you can get the diagrams for all the mechanisms from David Carter's [site](http://www.popupbooks.com/surprise.html)

by Paul Jackson

A great book for learning the various techniques about popups. The first section covers one-piece techniques using one sheet of paper and cutting it. Then multi-piece techniques with gluing on other pieces. Finally a section full of examples of designing popups with directions for building them, as well as many examples of professional popups.

This is one of a series of books about folding paper.

### Creative Pop-Up: A History And Project Book: A Fascinating Introduction To Paper Engineering, With 50 Step-By-Step Folds And Projects

by Trish Phillips, Ann Montanaro

As the title suggests, this has 50 well-thought out projects of varying difficulty. It also has a great section about the history or popups.

## Cards

### Best Greeting Cards

by Keiko Nakazawa

Ondori publishes many good pop-up books, and this one has many greeting card ideas. Included are many interested 180&deg; and 90&deg; cards, and more interestingly a 360&deg; design and many 0&deg; designs. The 360&deg; is a dice cube that forms when you open the card all the way so the front and back touch. This is the only book I've found with the 0&deg; designs. I've made a couple of my own, including the 2021 Christmas card, which I blogged about.

## Origami Architecture

### Paper Magic: Pop-Up Paper Craft

by Masahiro Chatani

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paper-Magic-Pop-Up-Craft/dp/0870407570?keywords=paper+magic+chatani&qid=1639348035&sr=8-1&linkCode=li2&tag=seekatar-20&linkId=6eb48eaa00d58a2ec07665ff08be5e8d&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0870407570&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=seekatar-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=seekatar-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=0870407570" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Another Ondori publication. I try to get all of Masahiro Chatani books. They have many great examples of OA, plus many interesting designs. It includes patterns for all the designs.

### Pop-Up Origamic Architecture

by Masahiro Chatani

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0870406566?&linkCode=li2&tag=seekatar-20&linkId=3a583f63808e7fca6eac8750fc462b03&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0870406566&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=seekatar-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=seekatar-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=0870406566" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Similar to the book above, but with different patterns.

### Pop-Up Greeting Cards: A Creative Personal Touch for Every Occasion

by Masahiro Chatani

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pop-Up-Greeting-Cards-Creative-Personal/dp/0870407333?keywords=pop-up+greeting+cards+chatani&qid=1639348622&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=li2&tag=seekatar-20&linkId=6b44c0e6aa4719d1c5b9a2f5894855cc&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0870407333&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=seekatar-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=seekatar-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=0870407333" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Similar to the books above. The title suggests that it's geared toward cards, but it has many buildings and other topics. As usual, all the patterns are included.

### Pattern Sheets of Origamic Architecture

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/4395270123?&linkCode=li2&tag=seekatar-20&linkId=f3cadfd0c97a78c92eb701d6ad2cf5db&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=4395270123&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=seekatar-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=seekatar-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=4395270123" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

In Japanese, this book has 77 building OA designs that Masahiro Chatani created and sent to the architect of the actual building. He got most of them signed. The book contains all the designs, with many printed larger on cardstock.

### The Paper Architect: Fold-it-yourself Buildings and Structures with 20 Ready-to-Use Templates

by Marivi Garrido, Ingrid Siliakus, Joyce Aysta

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paper-Architect-Fold-Yourself-Structures/dp/030745147X?keywords=paper+architecture&qid=1639348775&s=books&sr=1-4&linkCode=li2&tag=seekatar-20&linkId=15358fae1e0a51041fc517fc701a3411&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=030745147X&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=seekatar-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=seekatar-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=030745147X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

This book has patterns for 20 well-known architectural wonders of the world from the Colosseum in Rome to the London Eye. These ladies are amazing and the patterns included will keep you busy for a while. Each model has a page describing the history or the structure, and another clearly illustrated page about assembling the pop-up.
