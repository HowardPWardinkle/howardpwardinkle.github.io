### Pop-Up Design and Paper Mechanics: How to Make Folding Paper Sculpture

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1784945145?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li2&tag=seekatar-20&linkId=9ce0d2fcced465127a04acaaa1c8a59a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1784945145&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=seekatar-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=seekatar-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=1784945145" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

by Duncan Birmingham

For me this is _the_ book on pop-up engineering and I can not recommend it enough. It covers almost every pop-up mechanism I've seen in a well-organized fashion, with clear, color photographs and plenty of examples. Perhaps a bit too technical for some, I enjoy his comments on the theory behind the mechanism, and how adjusting one angle affects another. This is his revised version of his earlier book [below](/books.html#pop-up-a-manual-of-paper-mechanisms).

In this blog I will refer to the mechanism with the numbers from this book. For example, Foundation Shape 7, would be FS7 (parallelogram). See the [terminology](/terminology.html) page for details.

by Duncan Birmingham

This is the first Birmingham book, which I also recommend if you can find it. Smaller, and with black-and-white illustrations, it has 120 different mechanism, some with several variations.

As an aspiring paper engineer, I created every one of the popups of this book on 5 1/2 x 4 1/4 (quarter of a sheet of letter) paper.

### The Elements of Pop-Up

by James Diaz, David A. Carter

No longer in print, this one is interesting in that it is itself a pop-up book with examples of many mechanisms. Each little pop-up has a paragraph explaining it with the pop-up itself annotated with notes about angles and dimensions. Other mechanisms such as pull tabs and wheels are also covered. You get to see all the details of a mechanism from cut outs, or being able to see the back of it. In addition to the working samples and directions, you can get the diagrams for all the mechanisms from David Carter's [site](http://www.popupbooks.com/surprise.html)

### The Pop-Up Book: Step-by-Step Instructions for Creating Over 100 Original Paper Projects

by Paul Jackson

A great book for learning the various techniques about popups. The first section covers one-piece techniques using one sheet of paper and cutting it. Then multi-piece techniques with gluing on other pieces. Finally a section full of examples of designing popups with directions for building them, as well as many examples of professional popups.

This is one of a series of books about folding paper.

### Creative Pop-Up: A History And Project Book: A Fascinating Introduction To Paper Engineering, With 50 Step-By-Step Folds And Projects

by Trish Phillips, Ann Montanaro

As the title suggests, this has 50 well-thought out projects of varying difficulty. It also has a great section about the history or popups.

### Best Greeting Cards

Ondori publishes many good pop-up books, and this one has many greeting card ideas. Included are many interested 180&deg; and 90&deg; cards, and more interestingly a 360&deg; design and many 0&deg; designs. The 360&deg; is a dice cube that forms when you open the card all the way so the front and back touch. This is the only book I've found with the 0&deg; designs. I've made a couple of my own, including the 2021 Christmas card, which I blogged about.
