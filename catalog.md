# Pop-up Catalog

This blog started in March of 2021, but the pop-up cards started in 2013. This page is a list of all the cards I've made. Entries with links are cards that have blog entries.

If my math is correct, as of April, 2024 there are 207 cards in this list (179 entries + 14 combined entries + 14 birthdays in 2013).

|     | Recurring Themes  |
| --- | ----------------- |
| 🐱‍👤  | Cat is featured   |
| 🐭   | Mice are featured |
| 🦠   | Covid card        |

## Christmas Cards

Usually I'll make about a dozen cards for Christmas for friends and worthy family members.

## Origami Architecture Extras

Occasionally I'll take a OA pattern from a book of famous buildings and send it as a bonus. Most of these are from [Great American Buildings](/books.html#great-american-buildings-origami-cutouts-of-everybodys-favorite-landmarks)
