# Pop-up Catalog

This blog started in March of 2021, but the pop-up cards started in 2013. This page is a list of all the cards I've made. I've linked to any months that have blog entries.

If my math is correct, as of October, 2023 there are 199 cards in this list (171 entries + 14 combined entries + 14 birthdays in 2013).

|     | Recurring Themes  |
| --- | ----------------- |
| 🐱‍👤  | Cat is featured   |
| 🐭   | Mice are featured |
| 🦠   | Covid card        |

## Christmas Cards

Usually I'll make about a dozen cards for Christmas for friends and worthy family members.
