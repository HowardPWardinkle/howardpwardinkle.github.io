## Idea

Mother’s Day is in May, so Mom gets a bonus card!

Since the May cards use the same mechanism, I determine the basic mechanism to use first, then come up with two ideas to fit that mechanism. Usually it’s the other way around.

For this year ideas, I looked through [The Complexities of Pop-Up](books.html#the-complexities-of-pop-up) book I recently purchased and its predecessor [The Elements of Pop-Up](books.html#the-elements-of-pop-up).

## Cover

The May card are some scraps from young Howard's preschool artwork. I'd had this trimming for quite a while, just waiting for an idea to use them on.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The base is made of [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 270gsm
- Most of the interior was made using Michael's Recollections 176gsm cardstock. The white, yellow, and green are copier paper.
