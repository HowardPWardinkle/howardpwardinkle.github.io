November 2022 card.

## Idea

We recently went to one of the local fairs, which was quite a feast for the senses. The midway was a cacophony of sights, sounds, and smells. From the rumbling and screaming from the rides to the smell of cotton candy and many deep-fried "things" there was much to take in.

That's where this month's idea came from. I thought the chair lift and Ferris wheel would make a good back layer, and then put other rides and attractions up closer.

## Design

This is another origami architecture (OA or `BT5`) design, which I've already blogged about for the [September 2021](/2021/12/29/peoria.html) and [Virginia Tech](/2021/12/11/vt.html) cards. OA cards are cut from one piece of card and then folded forward and back to make the layers. This is a regular OA card with nothing too unique about the design. As I've said before, OA cards take some careful planning to get all the layers to line up correctly. In this one there are six main layers from the back of the card:

- Lift chairs
- Ferris wheel
- Tents
- Haunted house
- Duck attraction
- Ticket booth

In addition, the four front layers have groups of people on them adding a few more layers. I tried to give the idea of the scale by making things in the back smaller than the ones in the front.

I ended up with four quarter-sheet prototypes before scanning the best one and making a pattern for the {{ site.cameo }} on the computer. Amazingly enough, I got by with only one full-size prototype before making the final card.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

This is the base card, with some illustrations on copy paper cut out and applied to it.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The base and mechanism are on Michael's cardstock, which is quite a bit lighter than the usual Bristol paper I usually use for the base, but it turned out fine
- The mechanism was cut by the {{ site.cameo }} machine.
- The cover illustrations were done using [PrismaColor pencils](/supplies.html#prismacolor-colored-pencils) and [Pitt Artist Pens](/supplies.html#faber-castell-pitt-artist-pens)
