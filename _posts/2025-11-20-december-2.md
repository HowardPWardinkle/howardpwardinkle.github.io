## Idea

For the December card, I did a follow up to the birthday card showing the mice hard at work after the strike. My main thought was to have them building pop-ups or working on a machine that made them. I looked at images from Charlie Chaplin's 1936 film, "Modern Times" for inspiration. In particular, the scene where he goes though the gears of a giant machine.

## Design

I played around with some flat designs that had wheels and pull tabs, but I really wanted to make the machine three-dimensional. I leaned into the parallelogram mechanism again and made a large pop-up making machine operated by the mice. Even though it is three-dimensional, it still has pull tabs and wheels, making a simple parallelogram card into a more complex pop-up. I did one small sketch, then put the design into the computer and iterated a few more times.

After it was cut out, I illustrated it with colored pencils and pens. Here I'm outlining the gears and using a piece of paper to avoid getting ink onto the background.

I even sneaked in the mice playing dice in the back room. In the upper left you can see where"Don't Look Here" is hidden.

In addition to "Don't Look Here," there is a "Can't Look Here" on the back of the big gear.

The first mechanism I added was the big gear that had a mouse turning inside the machine like Charlie Chaplin. It is a simple pivot like I've done on other cards. There is a piece of card on top of it to hide the mouse as he goes through the machine.

## Cover

![Cover]({{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

I rummaged through my scrap bin for remnants and goofs from over the years to make the cover. See if you can identify any of them.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The base was [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 270gsm
- Michael's cardstock for two layers of gray.
- The illustrations were done using [PrismaColor pencils](/supplies.html#prismacolor-colored-pencils) and [Pitt Artist Pens](/supplies.html#faber-castell-pitt-artist-pens)
