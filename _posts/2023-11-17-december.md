## Ideas

As usual, November is a busy time for making the three December pop-ups: the regular December card, a birthday card, and Christmas cards.

TODO .

For the birthday card, the mice helped out again. Since Mom Wardinkle is 83 this year and 8 and 3 have similar shapes, I thought I'd use that as the central mechanism for the card.

Again this year, I tried to find a new Christmas-related topic I haven't used yet, and landed on the nutcracker.

## Advent Card Design

### Birthday Card Design

The animation at the top of this page shows the 2023 birthday card design.

Since 8 and 3 are essentially stacked circles I thought I'd have them overlap, then reveal 83 when opened. To do this I used a flap mechanism that when pulled, flips over the 3 to reveal 83. Of course, the mice had to get in on the action by pulling the flap. To add more action, the pull tab also pulls a line of mice near the front of the card and an airplane with a banner flying over the trees.

This pull tab is one of the simpler ones I have done since all three moving pieces move with the tab. There are no levels or arms that move in other directions. Below is the back of the card below it was sealed up. The moving part is outlined in green.

The base colors are from Michael's cardstock, and the illustrations are done with [PrismaColor pencils](/supplies.html#prismacolor-colored-pencils) and [Pitt Artist Pens](/supplies.html#faber-castell-pitt-artist-pens). For the "present" I used some patterned paper. The flap that pulls it was blue, so I thought I'd be clever and put a matching piece of paper over that area, but just that thickness of paper stopped the flap dead when it tried to slide into the slot. I had to redo the flap, and then color it white to somewhat match the paper.

Why blue and yellow? I don't know. When I did the sketch for this card I grabbed blue and yellow and it looked nice, so I stuck with it.

Everything was cut by hand aside from the numbers, which were cut by the machine.

### Christmas Card Design

I tried different mechanisms for the nutcracker, but decide to use a simple parallel fold to make a standing figure as the card is opened. This is very similar to the 2016 Christmas card below.

The 2016 card had no printing or coloring. For the nutcracker I thought about using a similar method, but for the front alone, it would have taken over twenty separate pieces. Instead I decided to use the {{ site.cameo }}'s print-and-cut feature, which allow me to us more colors and patterns. The cutting worked ok, but was consistently slightly off to the right (even though when running the calibration it was spot on). You may notice a bit more white on one side versus the other.

Designing the front and back of nutcracker for printing did take a while, but assembly was very easy. Like the 2016 card, there's a flap at the top that hides "Merry Christmas" and our signatures.

## Covers

The birthday card cover was drawn and cut by hand giving a hint of what's inside.

The Christmas card has no cover per se, and is just the front of the nutcracker.
