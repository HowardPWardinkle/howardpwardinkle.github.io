## Idea

When cleaning out some old boxes from my son's room, I found a bag of all sorts of cards: Pokemon, baseball, Toontown, Webkinz (remember those?), and a bunch of playing cards. Of the playing cards there were two complete Star Wars decks and a mix of other partial decks. In the partial sets there were a handful of ones with a classical design and I thought, "I can do something with these."

Mom plays bridge, so the obvious thing to do was build a bridge (I'm so clever) out of the cards. That was easy, but very plain. How to dress up the bridge? Then I heard a little voice, "Ahem. Mr. Wardinkle? We can take care of this for you." Once again, the mice come the the rescue!

What would the mice be doing on a bridge? First I thought it'd be a vehicular bridge, but switched to a pedestrian one since that opened up more possibilities. Finally I came up with four things for the mice to do:

* Fishing off the bridge
* Punting under the bridge
* A family walking up the bridge
* Bicycling mice

## Design

I used four playing cards on the inside, two for the bridge and two for the flat "road." As usual with pop-ups I want the biggest size that will fit in the closed card. In this case the "road" cards would be flush with the outside edge and then the two bridge cards went between them and would then fold flush to the outside edge. Easy! The angle of the bridge was dictated by the width of the card, and my standard 4&frac12;" wide card worked out with with a 40&deg; incline.

Since the cards were plastic-coated, I sanded them down were I would be gluing them. For the two bridge cards, I used strips of rice paper to make the folds on each side, and sanded a narrow area on each side.

Adding mechanisms to bridge was a bit tricker. With the bridge I have two new folds on each end of it, plus the main fold. I prototyped arms swinging out from under the bridge, but I couldn't think of something the mice would be doing swinging out under the bridge.

The family and cyclists are a twist of the right angle V-fold (`FS1`) with the twist being that instead of being on a 180&deg; fold, the bridge folds only open to 140&deg;. The red lines below are at 140&deg;.

The blue areas were cut out to make it look a bit fancier. One problem with that you cut away where the fold lines up with the base, the yellow star. A trick I use is after cutting the piece out on the blue lines, I temporarily tape it back in place so I can attach it to the base accurately on the stars, then remove the taped piece.

The fisherman and the punter use a technique I haven't found in any book. In both cases I have a fold and want to create a rectangle with uneven sides. In this case I know the angle of the bridge and that the fisherman and punter should be vertical. I've done this in a few cards, and the only way I've found to determine the lengths of the sides it making a drawing and try different length until it works.[^1]. Then try it out in a mock-up.

It worked fine, but if you look closely the punter's support curves a bit when it opens, which I think was not getting it glue in the exact location.

[^1]: If my math was better I may be able to figure it out. I think far corner of the rectangle is the intersection of an ellipse and a line.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

I used the remaining three cards for the cover, cutting a piece from each one to make it look like a hand of six cards. Not only did this double the hand, it avoided multiple layers of cards, which would have been much too thick.

The speech bubble was printed out and cut on the {{ site.cameo }}, as usual.

## Build

* 9" x 6"
* Aside from the speech bubble, everything was cut by hand.
* For strong, thin hinges on the bridge I used rice paper.
