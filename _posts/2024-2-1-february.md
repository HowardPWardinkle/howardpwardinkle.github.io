## Idea

I was working on some sketches for a February card, and nothing was working out very well. Then I thought about the news that Disney's Steamboat Willie in now in public domain ([Time article](https://time.com/6551496/mickey-mouse-public-domain-steamboat-willie/)). I watched the cartoon ([Disney's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBgghnQF6E4) or a [Hi-Res version with a deleted scent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jap-UBbmPsw)). The iconic scene most often shown is Mickey at the wheel of the steam boat. That would be complicated since much of the detail is at 90 degrees to each other. I thought the boat would be a good alternative, and started doing sketches of that. I always try to avoid searching for what others have done that may be similar, but did in this case to try to get some more ideas. There wasn't much in the way of pop-ups, and none were of very good quality, so I set out to do a good version of the boat.

Making an accurate representation of the boat proved to be more difficult that I'd hoped. There are many web sites about the cartoon, and many talk about its inconsistencies. When watch the cartoon, you will see that one scene conflicts with another. For example

- There are stairs behind the wheel in the close-up view, but not in the long view, and would go down right into the smoke stack.
- On the side view you can plainly see nothing on the front of the main cabin, but later on the front view, there is a big opening.
- The galley has a round window, but that is never seen in any outside views.
- The crane is white in some views and black in others.
- The stack of boxes on the back of the boat only appear in the first scene.
- The gunnel is very short in the long view, but much taller in the close-up view.
- The number of pots on the back of the main cabin changes depending on the view.

So I took my best shot of something that to crush the competition.

## Design

The mechanism for the boat is fairly simple, but the devil is in the details. Here's my design for the boat before starting to put it in the computer.

![Design](/images/2402/design.jpg){: width="{{ site.halfWidth }}" }
*Paper design*{: .image-caption}

The hull of the boat is a floating platform very similar to the pool from last [July](/2023/06/29/july.html). Using the fold on that platform, I added a box to create the cabin. Then on the fold on the roof of the cabin, I added another box to make the wheel house. Like the pool, the hull is surrounded by a piece of card to make the sides of the boat. Below in red is the middle piece of the boat. The main section in the middle goes through a slot in the center of the deck to push up the roof of the cabin. A slot in the cabin roof pushes up the wheel house roof to complete the structural part of the boat.

*Middle piece*{: .image-caption}

The deck has two more tabs on the left and right to hold up the flag, and crane, in purple. Likewise on on the next level are tabs to hold up the smoke stacks. And the small tab on the wheel house roof holds up the whistles. You can see that all of these items are be wider than the tabs to prevent them from sliding down as the card is closed.

I only did one very rough small sketch, then created the design in the computer to have everything cut out on the {{ site.cameo}}. Using the machine made it easy to make small changes as I worked through want ended up to be three full-size sketches. The first was just to make sure things fit. The second I "colored" many of the pieces to see how they'd look, and also did some fine-tuning of the mechanism. The third was one last set of fine tuning of the mechanism. The first sketch has a background that folded out and you could pull to the left to give an impression of motion, but that wasn't too practical, so I opted for a stage set background. Although difficult to see in the photo, each sketch has red ink and notes indicating what needed to be tweaked for the next cut.

With the hull being long and narrow, when fully open the fore and aft of the hull didn't sit quite flat on the card, so the bottom edge of the hull actually curves down 2mm on the fore and aft edged. Also this left a large space in front and behind the boat. I filled the front with the title screen from the cartoon, and for the back I added a panel that could be lifted up to provide the background for the boat. A pull tab could have done that, perhaps as the card opened, but I was running out of time, and it may not have worked well anyway.

To attach the boxes, I used tabs and slots to accurately place each piece, and also avoids more folds, which cause resistance. I had to build it from the top down, attaching the wheel house to the cabin, then the cabin to the deck. Then I could weave the middle piece through to the wheel house.

In the above photo, the boat has a support in the center, and on each edge. There is also a support on the right that will stick up though the deck for the cow. I had lots of options for what to put on the stern of the boat since Mickey uses a goat, cow, parrot, cat, goose, and a pig (deleted when aired on television) to make music. I opted for the goat and cow, since the mechanism is pretty small, the larger animals worked out better. I tried to draw Pete, his nemesis, but it never looked right, so I left him out.

![Crane](/images/2402/crane.jpg){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }
*Animals and the crane*{: .image-caption}

The crane is mostly paper with thread for the sagging rope and the hook. I used super glue on the thread to create the hook. You can also see I chose to leave out the boxes from the first scene, and go with only three pots on the back wall, along with the wash tub and wash board. Through the window you can barely see the "Potato Bin" from the final scene..

For the background I tried to faithfully replicate the background from the cartoon, and instead of leaving the back of it blank, I made it look like stage flats, with some stage hands working back there.

Being an inked cartoon, all the lines are black, I also inked all my lines.

This is fine, but when I folded the mechanism, the white edges of the card showed. To fix that I _carefully_ used a brush pen on all the edges to make them also black.

All in all, I think it turned out pretty well. The tiny details are a bit rough, but I think Ub would be proud.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The cover have the mice wondering if they will be in public domain. It is a printout from the cartoon, and illustrated with pens and colored pencils. The text balloons where printed and cut out on the {{ site.cameo }}.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The steam boat and background are made from 199gsm index paper, which is a light cardstock.
- The boat was cut by the {{ site.cameo }}, the background was cut by hand.
- The illustrating was done with [Pitt Artist Pens](/supplies.html#faber-castell-pitt-artist-pens) and [Prismacolor pencils](/supplies.html#prismacolor-colored-pencils).
