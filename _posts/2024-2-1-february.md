## Idea

I was working on some sketches for a February card, and nothing was working out very well. Then I thought about the news that Disney's Steamboat Willie in now in public domain ([Time article](https://time.com/6551496/mickey-mouse-public-domain-steamboat-willie/)). I watched the cartoon ([Disney's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBgghnQF6E4) or a [Hi-Res version with a deleted scent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jap-UBbmPsw)). The iconic scene most often shown is Mickey at the wheel of the steam boat. That would be complicated since much of the detail is at 90 degrees to each other. I thought the boat would be a good alternative, and started doing sketches of that. I always try to avoid searching for what others have done that may be similar, but did in this case to try to get some more ideas. There wasn't much in the way of pop-ups, and none were of very good quality, so I set out to do a good version of the boat.

Making an accurate representation of the boat proved to be more difficult that I'd hoped. There are many web sites about the cartoon, and many talk about its inconsistencies. When watch the cartoon, you will see that one scene conflicts with another. For example

- There are stairs behind the wheel in the close-up view, but not in the long view, and would go down right into the smoke stack.
- On the side view you can plainly see nothing on the front of the main cabin, but later on the front view, there is a big opening.
- The galley has a round window, but that is never seen in any outside views.
- The crane is white in some views and black in others.
- The stack of boxes on the back of the boat only appear in the first scene.
- The gunnel is very short in the long view, but much taller in the close-up view.
- The number of pots on the back of the main cabin changes depending on the view.

So I took my best shot of something that I thought would look good.

## Design

The hull of the boat is a floating platform very similar to the pool from last [July](/2023/06/29/july.html). Then two more platforms were added on top of that the make the main cabin and the wheel house. Like the pool, the hull is surrounded by a piece of card to make the sides of the boat.

I only did one very rough small sketch, then created a design and drew in in the computer to have everything cut out on the {{ site.cameo}}. I did this since it would be an iterative process to get the many tabs and slots aligned properly.

Then I did three full-size sketches. The first was just to make sure things fit. The second

For this card, the core of the design is similar, with three sets of stairs, but that's where the similarity ends. In an effort to give the idea that the stairs were going up very high, I made them smaller as they went up to get a forced perspective. The width of each set of stairs is different with the nearest being the widest, the lowest a bit smaller, and the highest the smallest.

Ideally, I would have liked the back set of stairs to get narrower as it got higher, but all of them must be the same width for the pop-up to work. I did make the depth of the treads get smaller as they went up. Also, the railing gets smaller as it goes up.

I could have adapted the digital design from the September 2019 card, which the {{ site.cameo }} cut out for me, but since this was going to be a very irregular shape, I decided to do it all by hand. After doing a couple smaller sketches, I drew the pattern on a piece of index (light cardstock) paper. This version has all the exact layout of the stairs so I knew that it would fold properly.

This is the same card, but I've drawn in all the illustrations, and taken liberties with all of the edges that will not be folded. On the top fold of the nearest stairs, I did make two of the treads hang over the front to mix things up a bit.

After cutting everything out by hand, I scored all the mountain folds and creased all of the valley folds, and did the painstaking task of folding the card while coaxing all the folds to go in the right direction. Since the creases create stress on the mechanism, especially on all the smallest stairs, I scored all of them on the back side to make all of the stairs open up nicely.

Like all OA pop-ups, this one is a bunch of rectangles built on top of one another. Here's the side view showing the rectangles.

The illustration is very much in the style of Shel Silverstein. I thought of making a mouse climbing the stairs, but thought that wouldn't fit the style. However, there is one hiding under the stairs.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The cover have the mice wondering if they will be in public domain. It is a printout from the cartoon, and illustrated with pens and colored pencils. The text balloons where printed and cut out on the {{ site.cameo }}.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The steam boat and background are made from 199gsm index paper, which is a light cardstock.
- The boat was cut by the {{ site.cameo }}, the background was cut by hand.
- The illustrating was done with [Pitt Artist Pens](/supplies.html#faber-castell-pitt-artist-pens) and [Prismacolor pencils](/supplies.html#prismacolor-colored-pencils).
