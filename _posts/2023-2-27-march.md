## Idea

Mom Wardinkle has been an "unexpected" landlord for a few years now, and has been ready to relinquish the title for some time now. Finally, the last house has been sold, and she is no longer a landlord! That's the idea for this month's card: a celebration of the unburdening of the yoke. The wordplay of homeless and houseless came to mind. Homelessness is a serious issue, and I don't intend to poke fun or make light of it.

I wanted to have someone burning the accoutrements of being a landlord and could really only think of 'For Rent' signs. There are many activities associated with the job, but not many 'things.' And since I can draw mice, they answered the call, again.

## Design

For the fire, I tried using a pyramid shape initially. A couple prototypes proved that it was just always looked too much like a pyramid. Using an open-top shape of a couple rings made a nice fire pit. The small sketch version looked fine with two rings, but the full size card needed three.

For the celebrant, I used an slightly acute V. To raise it, I had to span the main fold, so used a pile of signs to reach across the divide. To add a bit of interest, I put one sign on it with a slot. And it didn't want to lay flat, so I added some extra cardstock under it to give it more weight.

From the sketch, I found a tricky issue when the card folded. It was going to be tight getting the dancer to fold forward, and the fire to move up without hitting each other. You may notice that the back left quarter of the fire is a bit shorter than the rest to help that.

Gluing three rings that nest into each other can be difficult if you completely attach one first. Instead I marked where the first ring was to attach and glued only the left side. Then when cutting the tabs for the two outer rings, I made them the same size as the gap between the rings. This way, I simply glued all three left sides, one under another as shown below.

After that glue set, I glued all three of the right tabs, closed the cards, and crossed my fingers. Voila, three rings!

Usually I like to put some background color down, but since this has printed text, adding pastels or pencil over the text, just fades it. In this case all the signs did a nice job of filling the space.

For the pieces of sign that have been burned, I cut them irregularly and used black pastels for the soot. Then I crumpled up the sign to give it an even more damaged appearance.

The illustrations are done with pens and colored pencils. The text was printed on the base of the card, and all of the signs printed out. Everything was cut by hand this time, no robot assist.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

Like the inside, the cover text was printed then I used pens and colored pencils for the illustration.
