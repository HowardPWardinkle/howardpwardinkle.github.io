## Idea

Mice have been featured in July for [2023](/2023/06/29/july.html) and [2024](/2024/06/28/july.html), so what are they up to this year? They're going to the beach! That was easy. I thought it'd be fun to not only show the beach but also under the water.

I made of list of things to do at the beach. Some of these overlapped with the [2023](/2023/06/29/july.html) pop-up when they went to the pool. I came up with this list that made it into the card:

- Sunbathing
- Splashing in the surf
- Running on the beach
- Building a sandcastle
- Flying a kite
- Playing volleyball (which they also did in July of [2021](/2021/06/29/cheese-house.html))
- Beach umbrella
- Fake shark fin in the water, with a snorkeler underneath
- Submarine (yellow)
- Airplane pulling a Ron Jon banner

A few on my list didn't make it:

- Fishing
- Kayaking
- Swimming

And a few got added as the card was being built:

- Riding a bike
- Scuba diver
- Sea turtle
- Whale
- Sunken treasure chest

## Design

To make the beach and the undersea world, I needed to make a two-level card. One option was to use a floating plane like the building in the [August 2024](/2024/07/31/august.html) card. That would work, but since it's a 180&deg; card I wouldn't get a sky background. Another option would be to make a big V-fold, but that has the problem of the layers have to be tapered to fit inside the card when it closed. The final option was to use a parallelogram and a 90&deg; fold. Here'a a sketch of the design:

![Sketches]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2507/sketch-1.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf}}" }

The beach and waves can't be the depth of the card since as it closes, they move forward the height of the beach above the sea floor. So if the beach is 1" above the sea floor, it would stick out 1". I had to balance getting as much beach as possible with getting enough under it to make it interesting. I ended up with a sea depth on 1" and the beach and waves are 3 &frac12;" deep (the card is 4 &frac12;" deep). This way was the card is closed the front edge of the wave are at the front edge of the card.

To support the beach, I initially just had a whale the reached from the top to the bottom. Later I thought to hold up the mice on the beach I could use kelp that stuck up through the beach. The submarine and snorkeler don't reach the bottom and swing freely. In the sketch below you can see the blue whale and snorkeler, yellow submarine, and one green kelp behind it.

To make it more fun, I thought I'd add a kite and airplane that moved by a pull tab. I wanted the kite to go beyond the edge of the card. As is often the case, the small sketch mechanism worked fine, but the full size one bent the arm moving the kite. After doing some redesign on the full size card, and came up with a much better mechanism. Here's the part that pivots the kite. The hole on the lower left is the pivot point. The slot above is attached to the pull tab. It is a slot since as the pull tab moves straight left, it is rotating so a single hole would not work. Finally the thin arc is what the kite is attached to. The center of the arc is the pivot point.

Here's the mechanism on the back of the cover. The green part is the pull tab, which moved left. The red boxes are the stops that limit the motion of the mechanism. The two blue boxes guide the pull tab. The asterisks are the two points that go through the holes in the pivot. The orange slit is where the arc passes through for the kite.

And here it is in action with the kit attached on the other side.

The plane is attached to the pull tab, which is a bit of a cheat. I could have had a slot and had it be lower or higher, but there was the danger of colliding with the kite's elastic string, so I kept it simple.

The reset of the card is simply a bunch or parallograms as you can see from the side view below. Each item above has a kelp support that raises them as the card is opened. You can see the submarine and the snorkeler hanging freely from the upper layer. I let the umbrella find its own position, and it decided to tilt down a bit. The kite string is elastic thread with the slightest tension on it. The mouse flying the kite isn't perfectly on the pivot point so the distance from him to the kite varies a tiny bit, but stays taut. He's the only mouse drawn on the card itself and not part of a mechanism.

I did make a couple mistakes, which I'll own up to. First, I cut the slot for the kite in the wrong place, so I had to patch in a piece of card to fix that.

*Oops #1.*{: .image-caption}

The second is when I drew the kite-flying mouse. I drew it on the bottom of the card, instead of at the beach level. I had attached the elastic thread and was confused why is got to tight as the tab was pulled, and it was because it was too far from the pivot point. If you ever take it apart, you'll get a surprise.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The cover is the family wagon on the way to the beach. The car is a remembrance of a brown Rambler station wagon my grandfather owned, on which I learned how to drive a stick shift (before I was of age). The clutch was so soft I think it was made of marshmallows.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The base is [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 100lb with a printed background.
- The mechanism is on index paper.
- Everything was drawn and cut by hand.
- I used pastels for the sky, and colored pencils for the rest.
