## Idea

Motherâ€™s Day is in May, so Mom gets a bonus card!

For the past few years, my challenge for the May cards has been to use the same mechanism in different ways. Usually, I start with the mechanism and then come up with two ideas to fit that mechanism. I started a new hobby, beekeeping. I've learning about and preparing for bees since last year, and always knew I'd do a bee pop-up, and since I got my first colony in April, May was time for the honey bee pop-up card.

I was thinking about doing an old time bee skep, which is like a basket. One idea was to have the mechanism flat and a string in the center would pull the skep up forming the cone. That wouldn't have much movement and would need to be in the center of the card, limiting the design. Instead I decided to go with a modern bee hive in a box, like I have with bees flying all around it. To get bees coming out of the hive I used the reverse of a mechanism for the 2020 Christmas card where Santa was falling down the chimney.

Then for Mother's Day, I use the same mechanism adapted to a bouquet of flowers, as I've done the past couple of years. Hopefully the two cards are different enough that they don't look like the same mechanism.

## Design


## Covers

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The May was printed out. I must have dripped water on it after washing my hands and it created a spot. Since the card was complete, I leaned into it and added other defects.

The Mother's Day cover an illustration from an old encyclopedia, with some old Hallmark wrapping paper for the border.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The bases were [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 270gsm
- The May card was all cut by hand using cardstock and some clear plastic I had upcycled.
- The Mother's Day card was cut using the [Silhouette Cameo 4](/supplies.html#silhouette-cameo-4) and cardstock.
