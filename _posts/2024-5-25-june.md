## Idea

Usually, if I don't have an idea by mid-month, I start working a bit harder to find one. In my sketch books[^1], I do have a few ideas in the wings, but nothing sparked my interest, so I started looking through my heavily bookmarked books for some ideas. Looking through Shel Silverstein's [Runny Babbit](https://www.amazon.com/Runny-Babbit-Return-Shel-Silverstein/dp/0060256532), I found a short poem, *Ploppy Sig Reans His Cloom*, that I thought could make a good pop-up.

## Design

The illustration is a pig in a pile of junk. For the pop-up, I could easily make this multiple layers of junk using nested acute v-folds. This is my sixth pop-up of Shel Silverstein's work. The previous ones are:

- [January 2024](https://howardpwardinkle.github.io/2023/12/26/january.html), *Stairway*
- July 2020, *Strange Wind*
- July 2019, *Rainbow Thrower*
- September 2017, *Alphabalance*
- May 2017, *Runny Mets Guddy*

When making these pop-ups, I try to make the illustrations in Shel's style, if not a close copy of the original when making pop-ups of his work. In this case, it is pretty close. Since I have four layers of junk, I needed more than in his illustration, so I added other items that I could think of, including a few references to previous pop-ups.

Nothing very complex here. Just four identical V-folds nested inside each other. To make things a little more interesting, I used a bit of the "cutting parts away" on the first three folds. This is where something on the center fold of the mechanism is cut so it doesn't fold up with the rest of the mechanism. The first layer's tennis racket (?), the second layer's chair back, and the pig's ears all are on the center fold but are cut so they don't fold.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The illustration was copied by hand from Shel's illustration from [Runny Babbit](https://www.amazon.com/Runny-Babbit-Return-Shel-Silverstein/dp/0060256532).

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The base was [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 100lb
- The mechanism is on index paper, and illustrated with [Faber-Castell Pitt Artist Pens](/supplies.html#faber-castell-pitt-artist-pens)

[^1]: I started keeping sketchbooks when I started doing pop-ups in 2013, and am now on my sixth one. Since I've been blogging instead of writing in the sketchbooks, they don't fill up as fast as they used to.
