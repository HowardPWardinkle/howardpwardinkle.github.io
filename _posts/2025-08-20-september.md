## Idea

While on a recent run, I was trying to think about ideas for the September card. Since it was a trail run, I was thinking about trees. Trees have been featured in a few previous cards.

One Mrs. Wardinkle's favorites games is the "What?" game. If someone says something, you say "What?" and if they repeats it, you get a point. If the comment was about hearing, get get two points. If the person repeats it, but says "Ha!" before repeating it, no points are awarded. It's most fun to play with multiple people on a long car ride. The winner gets to choose where to eat (and hopefully not left behind).

A variation is when Mrs. Wardinkle hears an owl, she'll often say "Did you hear the owl?" and I'll say "Hoo?" and then we repeat that until she laughs with joy because it is so funny. That's what I thought of in my run in the woods.

## Design

Mrs. Wardinkle was visiting Ma Wardinkle this month, and I wanted to get the card done before she left, which tightened up my schedule. For the mechanism, I thought of a 180&deg; card with a floating plane for trees, and then have owls peek out on moving arms. ---- TODO

I first used Canson paper on the inside, which is a bit lighter than cardstock, but since I was doubling up that was fine. When I scored it to make it folder easier, I cut a bit too deep and the seam opened up. I glued on some rice paper with the idea of matching the color, but I noticed that the doubled up paper wasn't sticking to the base at all. I was using a Zig glue stick that was nearly empty. So I had to start again. Fortunately, I discovered that before assembling the whole card.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The cover's background is pastels for the background, smudged with my finger. The speech bubbles were printed and cut out by the {{ site.cameo}}. When I printed the bubbles, they printed in the location they would be on the card. That way I had a template of exactly where to put them. Here it is slightly offset so you can see the cover a bit.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The base is two layers of Michael's cardstock.
- The mechanism is on index paper, cut on the computer.
