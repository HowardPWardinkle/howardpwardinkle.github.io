Building a Board Book.

![Card]({{site.baseurl}}/images/hole-in-the-road/cover.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidth }}" }

## The story

A friend of Mrs. Wardinkle writes children's poems and stories as a hobby. We had discussed creating pop-ups or illustrating some of them. One of his poems, "A Hole in the Road", I thought would make a good board book. It is thirteen short stanzas about using animals to fill a hole in the road. That would work perfectly in a board book with seven two-page spreads, leaving room for illustrations. Unfortunately, life got in the way and we never got past a few conversations. Fast forward a year or so, and his health is failing. I thought it'd be nice pick-me-up to surprise him with a board book his work. After running it by his wife, I got the green light to make it.

Aside from pop-ups, I enjoy bookbinding. I have made several journals for Mrs. Wardinkle and relatives, but never a board book. Something new to learn.

## Design

For this book, I did all the illustrations. I wanted the final product to be rather cartoony, with black outlines and bright colors. To achieve that the illustrations would have to be in the computer. I can barely draw cartoon mice on paper, let alone on a computer, so I sketched all the illustrations on paper. Then I photographed them, uploaded them to the computer and traced over them using the software for the {{site.cameo}}. That is software is designed for the cutting machine, but I can use it well and knew it creates vector graphics. Vector graphics are drawings that, unlike a photograph, don't lose quality as you enlarge them. A curved line will be a curved line no matter if it's the size of a postage stamp or a billboard.

Being vector graphics on the computer allowed me to easily adjust the drawings since every line and shape is a separate object I can change. Is the giraffe's head not quite right? I can make it smaller, rotate it, or adjust the ears. Do that spot on the cow not look like Lake Michigan? I can fix that.

The layout was in two-page spreads with a left and right side. The first spread would be the inside cover, and page 1. The next is page 2 and 3 (odd-numbered pages are always on the right) and so on until the last spread of pages 12 and 13.

The cover is similar to a spread, except it has the spine of the book between the two halves. I couldn't print this out until I had built the book and could measure the spine width.

Since I knew I'd be printing on 8&frac12;x11 material, a spread (two pages) had to fit within 11". And the cover needs about &frac12;" extra for the spine. I decided to make the book 5" square. Spreads will be 5x10, and the cover will be about 5x10&frac12;. That's slightly smaller that a Sandra Boyton book, but still a nice size.

## Printing

You can get board books printed on demand, but it's very expensive, and you often have to order a large quantity. Plus it takes a long time. Since I can assembly the book myself, I thought I'd use a local professional printer just for the printing. When I asked about options for printing on something durable, they suggested self-adhesive vinyl, which seemed like a great idea. Little hands won't mess up laser-printed vinyl. But can I make a book with it? They gave me a couple of sheets of vinyl so I could do some experimenting. I created a small version and did other tests attaching the vinyl to boards and everything went well. The printer would take over a week, so I thought the local copy shop should be able to print on vinyl, but they would only print large-scale vinyl and it was very expensive. I submitted five copies of the book the printers and begin anxiously awaiting. I did multiple copies in case I made a mistake, and to be able to make another book, without the long lead time (and a discount).

Unfortunately, when I picked up the pages after ten days, I found they neglected to tell me about correcting colors for their printers. At first I thought I could use them, but looking at a red pig instead pink, I had to return them for a refund.

Disappointed, I went back to the drawing board. There is printable vinyl, but I had no experience with that and don't have great luck printing at home. I knew my current printer prints nicely on photo paper, so I tried that. Like with the vinyl, I created another small prototype, using different glues and methods to attach spreads to the boards. I also testing sealing the photo paper with a spray to make it water-resistant. Without sealer, a wet finger easily smudges the printing.

The tests went well. I printed the book out on photo paper and sprayed them with three light coats of sealer.

> One thing I learned, is you must cover the paper after you spray it. I found several places where little pieces of lint fell into the wet spray that I had to carefully remove.

## Deciding on the Boards and Binding

I wanted this to look like a board book I remember reading to Howard, Jr., such as the Sandra Boyton or Eric Carle ones. The thickness of those books' boards is about 1.3mm. I found cheaper board book with 0.8mm. For my boards, first I tried two layers of bristol, which produces a board that's pretty stiff when 5"x5", but too thin at about 0.65mm. I decided to got with mat board that was 1.2mm thick and has a plain front and back. I did look at using stiffer illustration board, but it always had a colored back with the company's logo on it, which would show though using vinyl (my original plan as you recall).

Here are three small samples I made with 1&frac34;"x1&frac34; boards. With these I could test assembly methods and durability of the materials.

*From left: Two layers of bristol, vinyl, and photo paper prototypes*

Researching I found that the cover typically used for board books is called a drop spine cover. The cover is of stiff paper, about half the thickness of the boards. It is glued completely to the front, and on the back a spine-width's area is left unglued to allow it to open as the book opened. Here's how I glued the back of the cover.

*Where to glue the inside of the cover*

The photos below show the prototypes with covers attached. When closed, the cover wraps snugly around the book. On the right, the last page is opened and you can see the drop spine forming an open square under the book. I found that making the spine of the cover slightly bigger than the spine of the book prevented the first page from partially opening, as the prototypes show in varying degrees. Also with the prototypes being very small, even the fold of the paper can open the book a bit.

## Making the Boards

The book required eight boards, each 5" square. Usually when building a book, you trim the built book after it is assembled to get nice flag outside edges. Since this book has paper attached to boards that must have very accurate alignment on the folds, I decide to cut the boards as accurately as possible to the final size. Ideally the edges would just need a bit of sanding to clean them up.

To make accurate as possible cuts, I created a jig using two framing squares that created a very square rectangle to allow me to cut 5" squares. In the photo below I'm using a combination square on the left to ensure the opening is 5" all the way across.

![Cutting jig](/images/hole-in-the-road/20230128_132734.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidth }}" }

When making a book, grain of the material is important. The grain of the paper and boards should be parallel with the spine. I determined the mat board's grain and marked each square as I cut them to keep the grain aligned.

They came out pretty dang close, not perfect, but close. After cutting about a dozen, I selected the eight flattest ones, picked the squarest corner for the top near the spine and marked each board. That way when assembling the spreads I should be a nice perpendicular fold down the center of the spread. In the photo below we're looking down at what will be the spine of the book. I've marked the head (top) of the boards with a mark on the left, and put a diagonal line down the boards to help keep them in order.

## Attaching to the Boards

The photo paper isn't self-adhesive, so I had to rely on my bookbinding (dare I call them) skills to attach the paper to the boards. Since photo paper is pretty slick, I sanded the back of each sheet to give the paper a bit more tooth.

![Sanding the paper](/images/hole-in-the-road/20230204_132145.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }
{:.image-caption}

When glues two boards to a spread, there were things I had to get right:

1. The spread must be perfectly aligned in the jig with its fold on the jigs center mark
2. The tops of the two boards, must be in a line
3. The edges of the two boards at the fold, must be at 90&deg;, and meet perfectly.

The printouts are on 8&frac12;x11 paper, but the spread is 5x10. To mark that 5x10 outline, all the printouts had registration lines on the corners and the center as you can see below. Since I'd be putting them face down with the top against a ruler for alignment, I transferred the fold line to the back lightly with pencil.

![Pages with registration marks](/images/hole-in-the-road/20230204_131727.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidth }}" }

For the gluing jig, I taped a ruler to my working surface and marked a vertical line that will be the fold of the spread. The spread's registration line will be aligned with that. To align the top edge of the spread with the ruler, I cut a small tab on each side on the horizontal registration line. The left photo below show the tab cut and folder from the top view, and the right photo shows it face down aligned with the ruler.

{:.image-caption}

The next photo has a spread against the green ruler and you can see the vertical line in the middle of the spread. There's a mark on the rule I used to line up the center of the spread on the line. Since I want the top of the book to be the better side, I made the ruler the top edge when putting down the paper.

![Mounting jig](/images/hole-in-the-road/20230204_133834.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidth }}" }

The boards are pre-cut to size, but the paper is larger so that it can be trimmed after it is attached to the board. To help align the paper, I cut a notch on the registration mark that will rest on the ruler.

When the gluing starts, you need to have everything ready to go. No running around looking for a scraper or paper towel when you have glue on a board. Here I have a stack of waste paper for gluing each board in the upper left. My glue brush is sitting on the lid I use to hold the glue, the boards are stacked in order and the spreads are also at hand, and in order.

![Ready to glue](/images/hole-in-the-road/20230204_134244.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidth }}" }

When I was going to use self-adhesive vinyl, I could build the entire book at once since there is no drying time for the adhesive. When gluing photo paper to boards, I let the glue set for about four hours before attaching it to the other side of it. For this to work, I will have to have three gluing sessions. In session one, all eight boards get one side glued, the inside cover, and pages 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, and 13 as shown below.

![Gluing up1](/images/hole-in-the-road/GluingUp1.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }

Here's after session one with four spreads all glued down.

![Boards from session one](/images/hole-in-the-road/20230205_063437.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidth }}" }

To prepare for the next session I trimmed the excess photo paper off so the boards, and folded the spread. The made a doubly thick boards that would be attached together in the next spread. -- I had a helper.

![Kitty helper](/images/hole-in-the-road/20230205_064140.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }

For session two. I used the folded spreads from session one. Then I repeated the process from session one, using the folded boardd from that session. For example I could glue the spread with pages 2 and 3 on the backs of pages 1 and 4. Similarly for pages 10 and 11.

![Gluing up2](/images/hole-in-the-road/GluingUp2.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }

With only one spread left for the final session, I could glue the 6-7 spread on the backs for 5 and 8 from session two. After this session, all pages are glued and just about ready for the cover!

![Gluing up3](/images/hole-in-the-road/GluingUp3.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }

I mentioned grain *should* run parallel to the spine when building a book. I broke that rule since the only way to print a spread was with the grain the long way. Here you can see the page curving a bit showing that the grain runs length-wise with the page. Whether it was since I was attaching it to a board, or that it was photo paper, I got lucky and the boards didn't warp when gluing on the photo paper. Also, I did always dry any glued paper under a lightweight for at least four hours.

## Cover Debacle

The front cover hinge moves a full 180&deg; when you use the book giving that fold quite a bit of stress. The other hinge points only move about 90&deg; so have an easier time of it. The photo paper itself was too weak for the cover so I planned on gluing it onto heavy bristol paper to make it stiff enough. I scored the bristol paper to make the bending easier, which makes a rough edge. This is ok for the bristol since it'd be covered with the photo paper. The debacle came when I folded the photo paper after it was glued up. As I feared, it cracked as shown below.

I hoped a light sanding would make it neat, but it remained a rather ugly, ragged edge. Also, it would not wear very well and probably peel open after handling.

## Recovery

(👆See what I did there?) The cover worked great when I did my vinyl prototypes, so I thought I'd try out printable vinyl. Using that over the bristol worked great. Being flexible the vinyl could take the punishment of bending without cracking.

## Cover Debacle Part 2

Now that I had a stiff cover, the next step was to glue it onto the book block using the same techniques as gluing the photo paper onto the boards. As I was shaking my bottle of PVA glue I must have hit something since suddenly glue started flying everywhere! What a mess. Mrs. Wardinkle helped clean up the mess and I managed to get the cover on as the bottle leaked on my desk. Afterward, I sacrificed a nearly empty hot sauce bottle to replace it.
