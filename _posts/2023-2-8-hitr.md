## The story

A friend of my wife is an writes of children's poems and stories as a hobby. We had discussed creating pop-ups of some, or illustrating them. One of his poems, "A Hole in the Road" I thought would make a good board book. It has 13 short stanza and is about using animals to fill a hole in the road. Unfortunately life got in the way and we never got past a few conversations. Fast forward a year or so, and his health is failing. I thought it'd be good to surprise him with a board book of "A Hole in the Road". After running it by his wife, I got the green light to go ahead and make it.

Aside from pop-ups, I enjoy book binding. I have made several journals for my wife and relatives, but never a board book. Something new to learn.

## Design

For this book, I did all the illustrations. I wanted the final product to be rather cartoony, with black outlines and bright colors. To achieve that, I took photographs of all of the sketches, uploaded them to the computer, then created vector graphics of them. Vector graphics are images that, unlike a photograph, don't lose quality as you enlarge them. A curved line will be a curved line now matter if it's the size of a postage stamp, or a bill board.

I am proficient with the software for the {{ site.cameo }} that I use for cutting out pop-ups, so why not just use that. You like what you know, and it worked out great. Being vector graphics in the computer allowed me to easily change things since every piece of geometry is a separate object I can change. It the giraffe's head too big? I can make it smaller. Are the spots on the cow not accurate representations of the Great Lakes, I can fix that.

The layout was in two-page spreads with a left and right side. The first spread would be the inside cover, and page 1. The next is page 2 and 3 (odd numbered pages are always on the right) and so on until the last spread.

The cover is similar to a spread, except it has the spine of the book between the two halves. I couldn't print this out until I had built the book and could measure the spine width.

Since I knew I'd be printing on 8&frac12;x11 the spread had to fit within 11", and I'd need about &frac12; extra for the cover spread, so I decided to make the book 5" square.

## Printing

Instead of printing it myself, I thought I'd use a real printer. You can get board books printed on demand, but it's very expensive, and you often have to order a large quantity. Plus it takes a long time. When I asked about options for printing on something durable, they said they could print on self-adhesive vinyl, which seemed like a great idea. Little hands won't mess up vinyl with laser printing. They gave me a couple sheets of vinyl so I could do some experimenting. I created a small version, and did other tests attaching the vinyl to boards and everything went well. And vinyl doesn't have grain like paper, so I didn't have that to worry about. So I submitted the spreads for printing.

Unfortunately, when I went to pick up the pages after two weeks, I found they neglected to tell me about correcting colors for printing on their printers. I thought I could use it, but looking at a red pig instead pink, I had to return them for a refund.

Back to the drawing board. I saw there is printable vinyl from office supply stores, but I had no experience in that. Also after the frustration with the printer, I went with something I knew would print well, photo paper. I printed everything out on photo paper, then used a spray sealer from the craft store to make the images water resistant. Without the sealer, any amount of moisture would dissolve the printing.

## Making the Boards

The book requires eight boards, each 5" square. My plan was to put the vinyl face down and using a jig, place the board on the vinyl. The boards needed to be as exactly 5" as possible since I didn't want to try to trim it after it was built.

Looking at commercial board books, the board range from mm to mm in thickness. I purchase a matt board at the local craft store that was 1.2mm thick, which worked nicely for a 5" book.

To make as accurate as possible cuts, I created a jig using two framing squares, and create very square rectangle to allow me to cut 5" squares. I the photo below I'm using a combination square on the left to make sure the opening is even all the way across.

When making a book grain of the material is important. The grain of the paper and boards should be parallel with the spine. I determined the mat board's grain and marked each square as I cut them to keep the grain aligned.

They came out pretty dang close, not perfect, but close. After cutting about a dozen, I picked the squarest corner for the top near the spine and marked each board. That way when assembling the spreads I should be a nice perpendicular fold down the center of the spread.

## Attaching to the Boards

The photo paper isn't self adhesive, so I had to rely on my book binding knowledge to attach the paper to the boards.
