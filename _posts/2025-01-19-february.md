## Idea

On September 25, 2018, I received an email from Ma Wardinkle with the title "Tada! - Look what I found!" and it was a old photo booth picture of Pa Wardinkle as a young lad and his very best friend J.J. I'd guess the photo was taken around 1950 or so. It's been sitting in my inbox for several years now, and I've always thought someday I'll use that in a pop-up.

February is Pa Wardinkle's birthday and passing month, and every year I've tried to come up with an idea with no success. I thought of creating a photo booth pop-up and use the photo, but I couldn't figure out how to make it work. When visiting Ma this past Christmas, she told a story we've all heard many times of how Ma and Pa met. Pa was driving down the street in a bedframe go kart. Ma was with a friend and ask who that boy was. Her friend made introductions, and the rest is, as they say, history.

I don't know if they were in a malt shop or not, but took the liberty, since that made it interesting. The Y is also feature prominently from a story Pa would tell about him and JJ swimming naked at the Y every time we drove by it.

## Design

I do not have mice for parents. I had figured out the design, and done a sketch with humans, but with my skill level they'd look a bit less human. I thought of using mice-like bodies and photos for heads, but then thought just use mice, and I think it worked out well. (The mice are so helpful!)

To make this scene I wanted to use the Origami Architecture technique I've used before. This is when I use one piece of card with nothing glued on. It a sort of puzzle to figure out how to make all the levels work from one piece. This one isn't too complicated. The Y is one level, and the bedframe and the driver are two different levels from the Y.

The street post in just one.

The malt shop is two levels, like I've never done before. Usually, the levels are in front of the previous ones, like stairs. For the malt shot, Ma and her friend go backwards, into the malt shop -- still out of one piece of card. The size of that part is greatly restricted since it is cut out of the malt shop's window. I had to have enough area for the two figures, and a bit to attach to the base.

Since I would be doing quite of bit of illustrating on the mechanism, I created it in the computer and has the {{ site.cameo }} cut it out. That way I could make sure it was correct, which the first cut wasn't. I made a few adjustments and was confident to use the second cut.

Since its cut out of one piece, there are gaps where the base will show through. So I colored the base to match the illustrations on the mechanism.

This picture above it the base, which has the cover on the reverse of the top half. On the left is the area under the Y, which has Pa, JJ, and their fields cavorting in the pool, sans suits. The center is the area left by the street post, which is just more grass. The right side in the area under the malt shop. I printed the checkerboard floor, and added the soda fountain, a couple more patrons and a soda jerk.

The left photo below is lit from a low angle and you can plainly see the cuts of the mechanism over the base, but they blend in pretty well in the right photo with light from a higher angle.

It was tricky gluing the figures to the base in the malt shop. I had to do it after the rest the mechanism glued to the base. As you can see from the side view above, I didn't get it quite vertical. In hindsight, I should have made the flap for the figure so behind. Instead it went forward, so I had to put a piece of checkerboard to cover that up.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

I didn't use a Shel-like image for the cover, instead used a don't walk sign. It was done with [PrismaColor pencils](/supplies.html#prismacolor-colored-pencils) and [Pitt Artist Pens](/supplies.html#faber-castell-pitt-artist-pens) with a background of pastels.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The base was [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 270gsm
- The mechanism was index paper, all cut by hand
- The illustration was done with [Pitt Artist Pens](/supplies.html#faber-castell-pitt-artist-pens)
