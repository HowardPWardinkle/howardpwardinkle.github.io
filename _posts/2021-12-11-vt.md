Four (and a half) Year of VT Popups<!--more-->

![graduation]({{site.baseurl}}/images/vt/VT-Graduation.gif){: width="{{ site.imageWidth }}" }

Howard Jr. is graduating from Virginia Tech this fall! It's been quite a ride during the pandemic, but he has done it and we can't be more proud of him. During his college career I've made a pop-up for his birthday, which is shortly after the start of the fall semester. This post covers all of them.

## Freshman Year

![2017]({{site.baseurl}}/images/vt/VT-2017.JPG){: width="{{ site.imageWidth }}" }

### Idea

After moving him into his dorm room, I thought it'd be neat to create a pop-up of the room itself. It was a typical small dorm room with two people, and I modeled one side of the room.

### Design

The two boys had their beds up high, with the left one having his desk under the bed. In the center is the fridge/microwave.

For this pop-up I used the origami architecture (OA) technique (a.k.a. Counter Folds `BT5`). I enjoy this technique since it is cut from one piece of paper, so you have to do careful planning.

I always use the {{ site.silhouette }} when doing OA since it usually takes a couple passes to get everything the way you want. The smallest size that works is 2mm since anything smaller tends to be too weak.

As with most OA, once cut out, it usually takes quite a while to get all the folds going the right direction and cleanly closing with the card. Scoring the folds helps, but you have to be very exact since the paper can split if you're off a bit on a mountain fold. Debossing works well, too.

## Sophomore Year

### Idea

I didn't rack my brain too much and ended up with a theme. Yes, another OA dorm room pop-up.

### Design

This time, I could model both sides of the room. (Freshman year didn't have much on the other side.) Howard Jr. is on the right (stacked monitors again).

Like last year, I used the origami architecture (OA) technique. By doing both sides of the room, I doubled my workload since there are really two pop-ups in one [Alright, double prizes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEp3zvFzB2s)).

## Junior Year

![2019]({{site.baseurl}}/images/vt/VT-2019.JPG){: width="{{ site.imageWidth }}" }

### Idea

Do you see the pattern yet? This year he was in an apartment and doing the room didn't work, so I decided to just do the desk. This is the desk you've seen in the previous years, just up-close and personal.

### Design

YAOAPU (Yet Another OA Pop-Up). This is a bit simpler since it is smaller, even with the more detail. One new addition to this year's pop-up is debossing of text on the monitor, keyboard, and some papers on the lower right side of the desk.

## Senior Year

![2020]({{site.baseurl}}/images/vt/VT-2020.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidth }}" }

### Idea

I broke the pattern this year, since he was in the same apartment with the same arrangement. This year I modeled one of the more iconic VT buildings, [Torgersen Hall](https://vt.edu/about/locations/buildings/torgersen-hall.html).

### Design

(Yes, YAOAPU). I like the way this came out. For doing buildings like this I start with photos, and pull them into the {{ site.silhouette }}'s software and start tracing over it. You'll notice that there are multiple levels, so the facade has to be split up in the pop-up, moving sections up or down on the pages to create the offsets. Using a 2mm grid when laying out helps getting things lined up.

One thing I noticed afterwards are the unnecessary cuts on the rooftops.

## Super Senior Year

![2021]({{site.baseurl}}/images/vt/VT-2021.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidth }}" }

### Idea

The [pylons](https://vt.edu/about/locations/buildings/pylon-names/pylon-gallery.html) war memorial is the most iconic structure on the beautiful VT campus. It consists of two rows of four pylons honoring the VT alumni who have lost their lives in the line of duty.

On my first visit to the campus I thought it would make a good pop-up. Pop-ups can seem light, and fun, but in this case it had to be serious, and respectful of the subject matter.

### Design

I finally break from the OA pattern this year. It would be possible, but since the pylons overlap quite a bit the final result would have a full pylon in the front and a thin ghost of one for each behind it. Also the pylons tops would have to be attached to the back of the card, somewhat ruining the effect of the free-standing structures.

This was the most difficult design of the lot. The pylons must all stand up perfectly vertical, and be perfectly aligned. There are three two step pieces and a top. The top has eight slots cut for the pylons with pretty tight tolerances, which create the perfect layout of the pieces. Each pylon is attached to the bottom of the top, and during assembly I would attach each one to the base in the exact location to ensure it stood up vertically.

The photo above shows the debossing of each pylon's sculpture. The outward tilt is an artifact of the close-up photo. They are vertical.

## Graduation

![Graduation]({{site.baseurl}}/images/vt/VT-Graduation.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidth }}" }

### Idea

The last one is the series is the animated pop-up featured at the top of this post. For graduation cards, it seems like mortar boards, gowns, and scrolls are the entire range of topics. I was going to do the hat, but it seemed too, well, old hat. So I ended up with just the VT logo and the year.

### Design

Fortunately, the VT logo makes a V shape from the left side of the V to the right side of the T's tail that is very close to the center of the logo. If you draw imaginary lines down from those, they will meet on the center fold right about under "Congratulations' '. Once that was determined, I could figure out the maximum height I could make it, and still fit in the card when folded. The upper-right part of the T was the part to watch out for.

So the basic mechanism is a right-angle V fold (`FS1`) that is truncated (the vertex isnâ€™t part of the mechanism) with a platform on top to form the VT. The year is just a couple parallelograms (`FS7`) added to each side of the main mechanism (`BT2`).

## Builds

* Most are my typical size of 9" x 6.5", aside from the two buildings.
* All were cut on the {{ site.silhouette}}
* Most of the OA is [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 100lb, or Office Depot Bristol, which is a bit lighter. The graduation mechanism is on photo paper since my printer couldn't get decent color otherwise.
* The dark-red base for most cards is Michael's cardstock.
