April 2023 card.

[![Card]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2304/popup.gif){: width="{{ site.imageWidth }}" }](/images/2304/popup.gif "Click to replay in a new tab"){:target="_blank"}

## Idea

This one is pretty obvious if you've read my [blog](/2023/02/08/hitr.html) about building a board book. In this pop-up I did my own version of filling the hole, this time with mice (what else). And with the mice nothing is ever straight-forward. In this case the three little kittens from my favorite series of pop-ups have a return engagement to attempt to wrangle the mice into the hole with moderate success.

## Design

I knew this would be a busy pop-up, which different mechanisms to render all the activity that I wanted to capture on the card. For the "page" from the book, I use a floating plane with a hole cut out. I printed the verse on the cardstock, and used the {{site.cameo}}'s Print and Cut feature to cut the hole on it, as well as all the supports. I could have cut the supports out by hand, but using the machine, all eight of them are exactly the same size.

The floating plane gives me a new main fold to work with. When making the card, I attached all the kittens and most of the mice before attaching the plane to the main card. The plane has three triangular supports on the center folder, and four on the outside. By using a triangular center support instead of a single, vertical one in the center, I get a stronger, less floppy floating plane.

From my sketches, I wanted to have a bag or box for the mice. A week or so before starting on this card, I purchased [The Complexities of Pop-Up](books.html#the-complexities-of-pop-up) by Diaz and Carter. In that book they have a mechanism called the "Off Center Stuffed Box," which was perfect for this card. Most box mechanism are on the main fold, but this box is off to one side, and uses a strap to pull the box up as the card opens. I created a few prototypes of it to figure out how to use it, then designed a pattern I could cut on on the {{site.cameo}}.

I kind of kicked myself for making the picture of the box on the cover so detailed, since now I had to make a tiny version of it. "Maybe the logo can be on the back where you can't see it?" "Nah, it'll be better to had it up front." After the inner dialog, I decorated the box as it is on the cover and used a punch to poke holes in the top. In addition there are some slots in the box for mice to peek out of.

I made the strap line up with one line of the text so it would be a bit less obvious, but you definitely can see it. On the back of the box is the only kitten with both its mittens holding two mice.

The black kitten and some mice are on an asymmetrical v-fold on the plane's main fold. Being asymmetrical allow me to have it angle back on the left side, but go nearly at 90&deg; on the right to avoid running into the box. The gray kitten, whose mitten is a bit more difficult to find, it attached to the asymmetrical fold.

All the mice in and around the hole is our old friends the acute and right-angle v-folds.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The idea for the cover came from thinking about how the kittens would get the mice. Where else but from Amazon. The illustration was done using pens and colored pencils for the illustration.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The base is made of [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 100lb
- Chalk pastel for the color on the base.
- [PrismaColor](/supplies.html#prismacolor-colored-pencils) colored pencils and and [Pitt Artist Pens](/supplies.html#faber-castell-pitt-artist-pens) for illustrations.
- The mechanisms are made from 110lb index paper, which is a light cardstock.
