## Idea

I was working on an idea for this months' card, but decided it would be a better October card. I shifted gears and looked at my list of ideas and poked at some of the possible study in black and white patterns. I haven't done cubes yet, so I settled on that.

## Design

I wanted to do a 180&deg; pop-up for the cubes. There are two options in that case, one with the sides parallel to the main fold, and the other using a 45&deg; V fold. I thought using the former I could use the folds on either side to lift smaller cubes. But that didn't work since the sides of the cubes make a 90&deg; angle, but to raise a cube, I need a 180&deg; fold. After some experimenting, I found I could use the strap technique to create additional 180&deg; folds.

Once that was figured out, I had to find the pattern to use. I first tried having the largest cube have larger squares, then smaller ones on the smaller cubes, but that didn't work. Using the same size squares on all the cubes worked better. That way if you get far enough away, and get at the right angle the squares on the cubes will line up. Here the top view with the squares nearly lining up.

And the side view, too.

Each cube is the same mechanism of a box with a lid that is pushed up by a support in the middle. The smaller boxes "main" fold is on a strap. In the photo below the card is partially closes. The red line is the strap for the medium cube on the right. The green line, which is partially hidden, is the strap for the smallest cube on the left. Blue indicates where the straps are glued to the card. As the card is opened the straps flatten out and the cubes rise. In the center of the medium cubes you can see the center support.

The largest one is on the main fold and had its support in the middle of the card. I had to triple-up the center support since the index paper bent and wouldn't push up the lid.

When doing the sketch, I scored all the folds with an Xacto blade, since that makes the crispest folds. However, I found that the folds at the bases of the cubes had too much stress and the scored folder would start to separate as shown below. In the final card instead of scoring, I creased those folds.

I created the base card, finished the cover and attached the four smallest cubes. The way the grid works, two have opposite color schemes, so they went on fine. When I went to put on the other cubes, I realized that the base pattern was opposite of my sketch. I had to reprint and re-assemble the five larger cubes. And I had a few other oops, such as cutting where a fold should be. If we need any checkered cubes, I have a few extra.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The cover is one of the few pieces of young Howard's preschool artwork I have. In this case I even had to use two pieces.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The base is [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 100lb with pastels as the background.
- The mechanism is on printed index paper.
