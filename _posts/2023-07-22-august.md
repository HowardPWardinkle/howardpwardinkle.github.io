August 2023 card.

## Idea

To celebrate the recently announcement of new colors and graphics for [Loyal](https://loyalhealth.com/), I decided to make a card with the new colors. The Loyal logo is a great graphic of a St Bernard dog's head. I've always wanted to do a pop-up of the logo, but never found a satisfactory mechanism for it. With the new colors, I decided to try again. In this case, I use the company's text and dog head logo in the pop-up.

## Design

I thought a neat design would be to sequentially raise each letter of the name as the card opened. This didn't work out since the descender on the letter "y" made two levels for the base of the characters. I ended up with a simple design with two parallelograms, one with the text and one with the logo. Being a simple design allows other people who may want to make the pop-up to use the same design.

As usual with pop-ups, the closed mechanism must fit inside the card. In this case, I had to watch as the letters will fold forward and the dog will fold up towards they stayed within the card as it closed.

All parts of the mechanism were cut using the {{ site.cameo }}. In addition to having the machine cut out the dark blue parts of the mechanism that make up the parallelograms, it scored the folds with light cuts. Scoring makes the folds perfect and makes the mechanism has less resistance when opening.  For the dog's head, the dark blue part is cut to the shape of the head to make aligning the white part on top of it easier. The tab on the bottom of the dog's head will fit into the slot of the larger parallelogram which has less resistance than a fold.

Each letter of the text is separate, so part of the design included a jig to align all of the letters on the parallelogram upon which they are attached. I taped the jig to the larger parallelogram, then starting with the "y", I glued on each letter. Below you can clearly see the slot cut for the dog's mechanism and the horizontal scoring.

Assembling the dog's head was a matter of aligning the white part on top of the dark blue part. The white cross is actually cut out of the dark blue part and made white by gluing a white piece of card behind it. I just used the inside of the 'o' for it. This avoided having to try to align the tiny white cross on top.

Since the top of the dog's head is not flat, the white part sticks up slightly to give it a better look that a flat horizontal piece.

Before step before gluing onto the base is to insert the dog's tab into the slot of the larger parallelogram.

Assembling parallelograms is pretty simple. I just take the length of the top of the larger parallelogram and transfer it to the base and glue it on. After that it's just a matter of gluing the other tabs, and carefully closing the card to let it finds its own position. I say carefully since you only want the glued part in its final position, and as the card closes, you can accidentally touch the card, getting glue on it.

The final step was to add the bright blue border, which is a pretty close match to the new blue, around the card. Then put it under a light weight for a few hours to keep it flat.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The cover is layers of Loyal tissue paper, with some Loyal-branded New Year's confetti embedded in it.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The blue parts are Michael's Recollections cardstock, which is 176/gsm, a bit lighter than I like.
- The white parts are made from 199gsm index paper, which is a light cardstock.
