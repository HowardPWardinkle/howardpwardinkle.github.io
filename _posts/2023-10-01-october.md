## Idea

October, Halloween. I've done a pumpkins, and ghosts in the past. I searched for decorations to try and find a new idea, and settled on a haunted house. And the mice make round out the cast of characters doing the haunting. A run down Victorian mansion is usually the typical haunted house. I looked at photos of those, and cheated a bit looking at other halloween pop-ups (I try to avoid doing that). After settling on a basic design, I wanted to allude to a 2013 pop-up I did that was a remake of 1960s Hallmark centerpiece, which we've had since I was a kid. Here's the original packaging and my reworked pop-up that's about &frac14; the size of the original. Note the tree and the kids in the foreground.

## Design

The basic V-fold makes up the majority of the mechanism. The porch, first and second story, and the tower are all separate V-folds nested behind each other. They aren't so complicated that I couldn't cut them by hand, but I did end up using the computer and {{ site.cameo }} to cut out most of the house. I mainly needed it for the porch, but by using the computer, I could get the slots for the tabs positioned exactly. I also could cut the roof angles precisely.

Here's the top view of the model and you can easily see the three Vs that make up the porch, house, and tower. The fence on the front is also a V-fold with a half an M-fold on the far left to turn it 90&deg; to the center fold. The fold behind the house is an obtuse V-fold so it will tilt back, away from the house and it closes.

I made the Vs 90&deg; on the base with the possible option of making the house totally enclosed. Sketches should that doing so make it much more complicated to assemble and required double the artwork on the house. There are quite of few hinge points on the house, and to avoid folds, which add stress to the mechanism, I used tabs to connect the pieces. The decorations on the porch root, and all the dormers are actually tabs that connect the roofs to the house. In the sketch photo above, you can see them more plainly since they aren't camouflaged. Tabs were also used to attach the porch roof to the house, and the tower roof to the main house. The photo below shows all the tabs.

The tab connecting the house and tower may not be necessary, but did help the tower line up right the the roof o the house.

When assembling the house, I completely put it together, then carefully aligned the house and glued it down. Second was the porch, which was a bit tricky since it has four rather small tabs to glue down on each side. Finally I glued down the tower. In the photo above you can see the tower's glue tab folds forward. This tab is cut to the exact distance between the house and tower so it made alignment a bit easier.

In my sketches, the left side was to support the tree as shown below. In this model, the tree caught on the top of the house as it closed, so I made the final tree smaller, but  it still had problem folding since as the card folded, the house flattens faster than the left wall, always causing the tree to catch. So the tree is now on the right side, and a ghost haunts the left side.

As my homage to the 2013 card and the Hallmark pop-up, I included the tree and the running trick-or-treaters. This time they're running away from the house instead of the tree.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The cover is a little hint as what lies within. The background is black pastels with the speech balloon printed and cut out with the {{ site.cameo }}. The other pieces are drawn and cut by hand.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The base was [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 100lb
- Most of the house was cut by the {{ site.cameo }}. Everything was cut by hand
- The other pieces are mostly cardstock from Michaels.
