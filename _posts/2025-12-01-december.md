[![Card](/images/2512/popup.gif){: width="{{ site.imageWidth }}" }](/images/2512/popup.gif "Click to replay in a new tab"){:target="_blank"}

## Idea

For the December card, I did a follow up to the birthday card showing the mice hard at work after the strike. My main thought was to have them building pop-ups or working on a machine that made them. I looked at images from Charlie Chaplin's 1936 film, "Modern Times" for inspiration. In particular, the scene where he goes though the gears of a giant machine.

## Design

I played around with some flat designs that had wheels and pull tabs, but I really wanted to make the machine three-dimensional. I leaned into the parallelogram mechanism again and made a large pop-up-making machine operated by the mice. Even though it is three-dimensional, it still has pull tabs and wheels, making a simple parallelogram card into a more complex pop-up. I did one small sketch, then put the design into the computer and iterated a few more times.

Here's the side view of this card showing its parallelograms.

After it was cut out but still flat, I illustrated it with pens and colored pencils. Here I'm outlining the gears and using a piece of paper as a mask to avoid getting ink onto the background.

I even sneaked in the mice playing dice in the back room. In the upper left you can see where "Don't Look Here" is hidden.

There are four interactive mechanisms on the card. The first one is the big gear that has a mouse moving inside the machine like Charlie Chaplin. It is a simple pivot like I've done on other cards (see [March 2022](/2022/02/28/dancing-leprechaun.html#pivot)). There is a piece of card on top of it to hide the mouse as he goes through bottom of the machine.

In addition to "Don't Look Here," there is a "Can't Look Here" on the back of the big gear.

The second mechanism is the control panel in the center. It has four lights and two meters that change as the tab is pulled. It is the most complex mechanism on the card since the lights slide and the meters pivot.

![Panel](/images/2512/panel.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }
*Control panel*{: .image-caption}

To get the lights to blink, the pull tab has green and red lines that move when the tab is pulled. Here's the pull tab colored in. The two cut out squares are where the tabs for the meters will go through.

Since the pivots for the meters are so small, I couldn't use the same method as for the large gear. Instead used a punch to make some discs out of thin foam. Here they are in green, glued to the back of the card. I had tried this before using paper for the pivots, but usually the disc of paper would split into multiple layers and ruin the mechanism. The foam isn't made of layers, and works much better.

Here's the back of mechanism, assembled with the meters attached to the hinges.

And here's the mechanism in action.

The third mechanism is the conveyor belt on the right. It is a simple pull tab that moves the pop-up cards along the belt.

*Assembly line*{: .image-caption}

Here's the pull tab ready to be attached to the card. The gray part will go behind the main mechanism, and the "cards" will go in front of it so when the tab is pulled, the cards appear to move along the belt. The first card had to already be started on the belt so avoid it catching when the tab is pulled.

And here's the conveyor belt with the cards on it. The three cards on the belt are the three December cards.

The last mechanism is a simple pull tab that ejects a mouse out of one of the pipe.

This was a fun card to design and make. It started with a simple parallelogram as the base and was enhanced with the four moving parts. I hope you enjoy it.

## Cover

![Cover]({{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

I rummaged through my scrap bin for remnants and goofs from over the years to make the cover. See if you can identify any of them.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The base was [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 270gsm
- Michael's cardstock for two layers of gray.
- The illustrations were done using [PrismaColor pencils](/supplies.html#prismacolor-colored-pencils) and [Pitt Artist Pens](/supplies.html#faber-castell-pitt-artist-pens)
