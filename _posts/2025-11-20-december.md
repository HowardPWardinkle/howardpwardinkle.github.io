## Ideas

As usual, November is a busy time for making pop-ups: the regular December card, a birthday card, and a this year we added two lucky folks to our pop-up Christmas card list making it fourteen!

The mice have been helping with the birthday card, and I hoped they'd help again this year. But there was a government shutdown, and the mice were not getting paid and went on strike. So this year no mice were involved with the birthday card. In addition, the colorists were also on strike, so this card is black and white. For the design I wanted to show the mice on strike, and I put them in front of two buildings that ____ to my name, and the "Don't Look Here" which is usually hidden somewhere on every pop-up.

> The origin of "Don't Look Here" is from one of the very first pop-ups I made, which was for my nephew. It had a figure riding a mountain bike, that moved up a hill as the card opened. There was a part the mechanism you could easily see that should have been hidden. To remedy that, I put "Don't Look Here" on it. Since then, I've secreted it on every pop-up (if I can remember).

For the December card, I did a follow up to the birthday card showing the mice hard at work after the strike. My main thought was to have them building pop-ups or working on a machine that made them. I played around with some flat designs that had wheels and pull tabs, but I really wanted to make the machine three-dimensional. I looked at images from Charlie Chaplin's 1936 film, "Modern Times" for inspiration. In particular, the scene where he goes though the gears of a giant machine.

I have a list of all the things we've done for the Christmas cards over the years. I try to do something different each year, and I had penguins penciled in for this year, and that's what I ended up doing. I thought of different ways to show them, and settles on three of them standing on a chunk of ice.

## Covers

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The Christmas card (top) is a printed penguin saying "Hi!".

The birthday card cover (middle) was drawn by hand (no color, only pen and ink).

The December card cover (bottom) gives a hint as to what's inside. I was envisioning an old-time college lecture hall.
