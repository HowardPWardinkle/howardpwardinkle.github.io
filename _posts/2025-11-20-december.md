## Ideas

As usual, November is a busy time for making pop-ups: the regular December card, a birthday card, and a this year we added two lucky folks to our pop-up Christmas card list making it fourteen!

The mice have been helping with the birthday card, and I hoped they'd help again this year. But there was a government shutdown, and the mice were not getting paid and went on strike. So this year no mice were involved with the birthday card. In addition, the colorists were also on strike, so this card is black and white. I thought I'd show the mice on strike in front of two buildings: one that harks back to my name, and another for "Don't Look Here," which is usually hidden somewhere on every pop-up.

> The origin of "Don't Look Here" is from one of the very first pop-up cards I made, which was for my nephew. It had a figure riding a mountain bike, that moved up a hill as the card opened. There was a part the mechanism you could easily see that should have been hidden better. To remedy that, I put "Don't Look Here" on it. Since then, I've secreted it on every pop-up (if I can remember).

*First don't look here*{: .image-caption}

I made the Wardinkle Building more classical in style, with a doorman out front. The "Don't Look Here" building is of a glass-and-steel box.

For the December card, I did a follow up to the birthday card showing the mice hard at work after the strike. My main thought was to have them building pop-ups or working on a machine that made them. I looked at images from Charlie Chaplin's 1936 film, "Modern Times" for inspiration. In particular, the scene where he goes though the gears of a giant machine.

I keep a list of all the things we've done for the Christmas cards over the years and try to do something different each year. I had penguins penciled in for this year, and that's what I ended up doing. I thought of different ways to show them, and settled on three of them standing on a chunk of ice.

## Designs

### Christmas Card

Since I make more than a dozen of these cards, I keep the design simple to make assembly easier. This year's card was printed out, then cut by the {{ site.cameo }}. The mechanism is all one piece so I didn't have pieces to glue on. The {{ site.cameo }} did the cuts and scored any mountain folds (like at the top of the penguins). For the other folds (like at the base of the penguins), I had to score all sixteen of those on the back of the card by hand.

*Ready for assembly*{: .image-caption}

After that, I could carefully coax the folds in the right directions to fold the inner mechanism flat. Here's the side view of the card.

![Side view](/images/2512/xmas-side.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }
*Side view*{: .image-caption}

And here's all of there ready for final assembly.

*All folded*{: .image-caption}

The inner mechanism is about &frac12;" small than the outer card to give it a border all around. The corners are rounded to give it a finished look.

The cover penguin was printed and cut by the {{ site.cameo }} as well. I glued it on the front, then glued the inner mechanism to the inside of the card to complete the build.

### Birthday Card

The mechanism for this card is the same as for the Christmas card, the parallelogram. And like the Christmas card, the inner mechanism is all one piece. Although very simple, I used the {{ site.cameo }} to cut out the mechanism for reasons which will soon be apparent.

Here's its side view and you can see the similarity to the Christmas card.

![Side view](/images/2512/bday-side.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }
*Side view*{: .image-caption}

This card has a secret message when a light is shone through the cover.

![85](/images/2512/85.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }
*Secret message*{: .image-caption}

For this to work, behind each building is a cutout of the numbers and the text. I had the {{ site.cameo }} cut out the numbers and text out of cardstock, then glued each piece behind each building.

![Backlight](/images/2512/backlight.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }
*Backlight templates*{: .image-caption}

Notice that there are pieces inside the 8 and many of the letters that need to be added to make them look like when they're printed. To align the the inner parts of the 8, I used its throw-away part to align the two inner pieces.

![85](/images/2512/8-before.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }
*Aligning the inner parts of the 8*{: .image-caption}

And here's the finished 8 with the inner parts glued on. For the B, D, As, and Ps, I eyeballed the alignment since they were so small.

![85](/images/2512/8-after.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }
*The inner parts glued on*{: .image-caption}

I initially thought of having a hole in the cover that you could shine a flashlight through, but it didn't light up the numbers very well. I tried two holes, and that wasn't very satisfactory. Instead of a hole, I cut a large rectangle out of the cover, and used thin printer paper to cover it. This diffused the light and made the numbers show up nicely.

### December Card

I played around with some flat designs that had wheels and pull tabs, but I really wanted to make the machine three-dimensional. I leaned into the parallelogram mechanism again and made a large pop-up making machince that was operated by the mice.

![Zig zag](/images/2512/zig-zag.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }

Most of the card was cut by hand. I did use the {{ site.cameo }} for cutting the circles.

## Covers

![Cover]({{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The Christmas card (top) is a printed penguin saying "Hi!".

The birthday card cover (middle) was drawn by hand (no color, only pen and ink).

The December card cover (bottom) gives a hint as to what's inside. I was envisioning an old-time college lecture hall.
