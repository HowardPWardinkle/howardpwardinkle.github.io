## Idea

When you can't think of an idea for November, a turkey will always work.

## Design

This is a 180&deg; card that uses a couple of different mechanisms. For the "feathers", I used three progressively smaller obtuse-angle V folds (FS4), each separated by 5mm. To get the feather spacing consistent and accurate, I used the computer to draw one, and then scaled it down for the other two. The obtuse angle is 190&deg;s, just 10 over 180 since I wanted it pretty vertical. In the image below from the editor you see the 190&deg; angle at the bottom.

From the top you can see the evenly spaced V folds.

For the turkey's body, I used the curved-shape (FS15) technique cut by hand. This is a somewhat ovate shape with the top half glued along the edge, and the base glued in parallel from the main fold to give it a rounded shape as it opens up. Then the rest of the turkey is a few pieces folded once and glued together.

The turkey must be forward on the card to keep the feathers from poking out of the top when closed, which gives an empty space on the top. I should have printed on the paper first to fill that, but didn't, so I used vinyl letters applied afterwards.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

For the cover, I used pastels sprinkled on through a kitchen strainer, then smudged around with my fingers. The pumpkins are some of my son's elementary school artwork (I'm sure he's glad we kept all that!).

## Build

* 9" x 6.5"
* {{ cameo }} to cut the feathers and vinyl lettering.
* The base is [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 100lb, with pastel backgrounds and hand-torn paper.
* The feathers are textured cardstock with a white core. I'm not usually fond of this since one side has parallel lines in the texture giving it a tendency to warp, but it does well for this mechanism.
* The rest of the turkey is colored cardstock and paper.
