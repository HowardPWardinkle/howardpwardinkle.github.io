## Idea

I recently started running again after stopping for nearly ten years due to injuries. To exercise, I first got back on my mountain bike and rode on the trails. Then I would ride and do a lap running on the trails. Before I could get about half a mile in before my knee started acting up and now I found I could go a full lap (about 1.4 miles) without any issues. I started running twice a week and now up to three times a week. I staying on the Dirty Spoke trail race mailing list for the past ten years thinking I'd sign up for a run, and I finally did. It was over ten years since my last Dirty Spoke run, and to celebrate, I made a pop-up card.

## Design

I wanted to do a running with the arms and legs moving.

![Runner]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2404/runner.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidth }}" }

Here's a series of photos putting together the prototype mechanism.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The cover is just some mice watching the race done with pastels, pens, colored pencils, and printed speech balloons.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The base was [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 100lb
- The mechanism was cardstock from Michaels.
- The inner mechanism was cut with the {{ site.cameo }}.
- The curve on the cover was cut by hand.
