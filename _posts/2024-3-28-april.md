## Idea

I recently started running again after stopping for nearly ten years due to injuries. To exercise, I first got back on my mountain bike and rode on nearby trails. Then I would ride and do a lap running. Before, I could only get about half a mile in before my knee started acting up, but now I found I could go a full lap (about 1.4 miles) without any issues. I started running twice a week and now up to three times a week. I stayed on the [Dirty Spokes](http://www.dirtyspokes.com/) trail race mailing list for the past ten years thinking someday I'd sign up for a run again, and I finally did. It was over ten years since my last Dirty Spoke run, and to celebrate, I made a pop-up card.

## Design

I wanted to do a running figure with the arms and legs moving, which meant using pivots with a pull tab like I did in the [March 2022](/2022/02/28/dancing-leprechaun.html) pop-up. One issue that first comes up is that the legs and arms move in opposite directions, but on the same pivot point. I knew that would be the trickiest part of this card. To see if it was even feasible, I made a small sketch, and it was doable.

For each set of limbs, there would two pivot arms attached be one point. The tab that moved the arms would have a hole above the pivot to move one arm clockwise, and a hole below the pivot to move the other counterclockwise. The plus sign in the sketch below is the pivot point, and you can see the holes for each pivot arm. As the white tab is pulled left, the yellow arm moves clockwise, and the green arm moves counterclockwise.

*Sketch*{: .image-caption}

As you may imagine from the sketch, since the arms move in opposite directions, and cross each other avoiding collisions would be a challenge.

Initially, I was thinking of using 90&deg; pivots for both limbs, but after looking at [Edward Muybridge's photos of a running man](https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/art-artists/work-of-art/running-at-full-speed) I found that the legs moved about 90&deg;, but the arms moved about 120&deg; as show below in an annotated frame.

Since the arms and legs move different angles, with the same pull of the tab, that meant the holes for the moving arms had to be at different distances from the pivot point. I did some full-size sketches to test things out. This took much more time than I thought it would, but I finally got it to work.

Here's a series of photos putting together the final prototype mechanism (this is actually a tear-down of it in reverse order).

Step 1 has all the mechanism parts. The left part is the base with guides for the odd-shaped pull to the right of it. The red circles are the pivot points. The green circles on the tab are where the pivot arms go through it.  The pivot arms for the right limbs are already through the upper holes of the tab. These go through the tab from underneath it, to avoid colliding pivot arms for the left limbs.

![Step1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2404/step1.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidth }}" }

Step 2 has the tab in place and the other pivot arms through the holes. The left limbs' arms go through the tab holes from above, then another layer of card is added to strengthen and extend them. At this point the arms will move, but collide. The legs can be attached to pivot arms since the angles match the legs' positions. The pivot arms angle and the arm angle are 30&deg; off, as shown by the lines below. The red lines are for the left limbs, and the green lines are for the right limbs.

Here's an earlier sketch in motion. I've bent the card to avoid collisions.

Step 3 has the right leg attached to the pivot arm under the other one.

![Step3]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2404/step3.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }

Step 4 adds a piece of paper to keep the arm and leg pivot arms from colliding since in the previous photo you can see the will overlap.

![Step4]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2404/step4.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }

Step 5 adds the main background of the card and the right arm. The legs have separate, curved slots to keep them from colliding. The arms both stick through the same hole since a torso layer will separate them.

![Step5]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2404/step5.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }

Step 6 has both arms and legs are attached. At this point the legs do pretty well avoiding each other, but the arms will still collide.

![Step6]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2404/step6.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }

Here's an earlier sketch of the mechanism in motion. I used this sketch to figure out how to avoid collisions with the scraps taped to the base.

Step 7 adds the last layer of the torso that has the right arm under and the left arm over. The arms are now separated and don't collide. One thing to watch out on the arms is that if they go beyond the torso when moving left, they may go on the wrong side of it, catching or colliding. The avoid that, I'd be careful to limit their movement to the red asterisk.

The final step is just a refinement of the large arm hole in the previous step to see how small I could make it. I want to make is as invisible as possible.

Here's the final mechanism assembled.

Although I did many sketches, the final mechanism seemed to catch a bit. I don't know if it was the type of paper in the final version, or bad luck. I narrowed down the problem to the left arm's pivot. If I removed that, all three other limbs worked very smoothly. I recut the parts a few more times, and even lubricated it with graphite as show below, and that seemed to help.

*Lubing it up*{: .image-caption}

I think the problem was with the small area between the upper and lower pivots. To get the arms to move 120&deg; the hole had to be pretty close to the pivot point, which didn't give much leverage and caused stress on the pivot itself. One problem that arose from that was the pivot developed some play, which allowed the right arm to move beyond the torso and then catch on it (see red asterisk in the step 7 photo).

To remedy this I did a "field mod" to the completed card that restricted the movement of the tab a bit.

The figure and base of the card are colored pencils, and ink pens. The main backgrounds is mostly pastels. The torso makes my butt look big, so maybe I need to work on that a bit. The mouse holding the pink sign is from when I ran my first and last marathon. Ma and Pa Wardinkle came out to cheer me on and beside the road Pa had a 4' x 8' pink piece of foam insulation with "Go Howard" written on in big letters. All I could think of was, "Couldn't you have used the blue stuff?".

This card took lots of tinkering and sketches to get it working, and more tinkering to get the final version to work. It's still a bit stiff, but it works. I did use the {{ site.cameo }} to cut many of the parts since they needed to be precise and circular. That was handy when I kept needing more parts to redo the arms over and again.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The cover is just some mice watching the race done with pastels, pens, colored pencils, and printed speech balloons.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The base was [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 100lb
- The mechanism was miscellaneous cardstock.
- The mechanism was cut with the {{ site.cameo }}, the rest by hand.
