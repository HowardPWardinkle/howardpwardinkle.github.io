## Idea

After hurricane Helene, we housed my quite pregnant niece and her two-year-old son since they were without power. He played with some of Howard the younger's toys, which we still had. And some of mine, too. One of mine is a rocking horse, which was built by my grandfather a few years ago (I will not divulge how many). He played with that quite a bit, and looking at it, I thought it would make a good pop-up.

## Design

Since the real rocking horse is made up of planes at 90&deg;, converting it to a pop-up was straightforward. I did two sketches for it. One was a 180&deg; card with the horse in the middle, a second, 90&deg; card with the horse against the vertical part. The former left lots of room on either side that I didn't know how to fill. The latter had less open space so I went with that.

I couldn't do the back of the seat with that model, but that wasn't a big negative. What to do with the blank areas was my next problem. I looked through books and searched the internet for poems about horses, but couldn't find any ones that worked for me. I eventually settled on a Mother Goose poem and adapted it for my rocking horse. I got the idea of having the horse dream, and the penny dropped. The cover would be the first stanza and the horse head. The interior would have the second stanza, the horse, and in the background would be the horse riding on one of the [mitten buttes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_and_East_Mitten_Buttes) in Arizona.

The mechanism itself is pretty simple with one vertical plane and three horizontal ones that were part of the real rocking horse. Below you can see the mechanism. You can also see the second stanza of the poem tipping up a bit. I've done this on other cards simply by putting a fold on the leading edge of the text and the cardstock doesn't lay completely flat, so it gives it a bit of dimension.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The cover has the horse's head cut by the {{ site.cameo }} out of red and white paper, decorated with colored pencils. Like the interior's background, the coverâ€™s background is pastel.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The base is [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 100lb.
- The mechanism is on Michael's cardstock with attached printer paper.
