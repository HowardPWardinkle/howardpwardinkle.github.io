## Ideas

As usual, November is a busy time for making pop-ups: the regular December card, a birthday card, and Christmas cards.

For the December card, I looked Shelia Sturrock's [book](/books.html#making-mechanical-cards-25-paper-engineered-designs), which has some interesting designs. I thought I'd use her `Pull-tab flower bouquet` design since she mentions it can also be used for a Christmas tree. It uses a pull-tab to lift seven parts to reveal the card underneath. Working with the sketch, it didn't show as much of the base as I'd hoped. But, it gave me a new idea for the December card showing the internals of a Christmas tree run by mice.

For the birthday card, I again had Ma Wardinkle's age revealed. Like last year, the mice helped, but in a more minor role.

After submitting artwork for her sorority's Christmas seal for several years, Mrs. Wardinkle finally was accepted. To celebrate that, this year's Christmas is her design made into a pop-up. Since I made a dozen or so of these each year, they can't be too complicated.

## Designs

### December Card

### Birthday Card

I have a small sketch of every one of the 120 mechanisms from Duncan Birmingham's [older pop-up book](https://howardpwardinkle.github.io/books.html#pop-up-a-manual-of-paper-mechanisms). I keep these and variations in a box, and occasionally look through it for inspiration. For the birthday card, I wanted have four parts of the number 84 converge as the card was opened. The box had some variations on that theme and I ended up using two acute V-folds with arms for each part of the number.

The size of the numbers was determined by the mechanism that had to fit within the card when closed. I made them as large as I could, but it did leave quite a bit of empty space around the numbers. In sketched I added four sets of mics on parallel folds. The ones on the top were awkward, so I did used them. One thing about the parallel folds that they lifted the numbers up a bit, so I added a ring around the numbers to have the tab for the parallel fold stay flat near the numbers.

## Covers

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The birthday card cover (top) was drawn and cut by hand giving a hint of what's inside.

The Christmas card has no cover per se and is just the front of the nutcracker.

Like others in the series, the December card cover is young Howard's preschool artwork with a small version of the pattern.
