## Ideas

As usual, November is a busy time for making pop-ups: the regular December card, a birthday card, and Christmas cards.

For the December card, I looked Shelia Sturrock's [book](/books.html#making-mechanical-cards-25-paper-engineered-designs), which has some interesting designs. I thought I'd use her `Pull-tab flower bouquet` design since she mentions it can also be used for a Christmas tree. It uses a pull-tab to lift seven parts to reveal the card underneath. Working with the sketch, it didn't show as much of the base as I'd hoped. But, it gave me a new idea for the December card showing the internals of a Christmas tree run by mice.

For the birthday card, I again had Ma Wardinkle's age revealed. Like last year, the mice helped, but in a more minor role.

After submitting artwork for her sorority's Christmas seal for several years, Mrs. Wardinkle finally was accepted. To celebrate that, this year's Christmas is her design made into a pop-up. Since I made a dozen or so of these each year, they can't be too complicated.

## Covers

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The birthday card cover (top) was drawn and cut by hand giving a hint of what's inside.

The Christmas card has no cover per se and is just the front of the nutcracker.

Like others in the series, the December card cover is young Howard's preschool artwork with a small version of the pattern.
