## Idea

Motherâ€™s Day is in May, so Mom gets a bonus card!

For the past few year, my challenge for the May cards is to use the same mechanism in different ways. I determine the basic mechanism to use first, then come up with two ideas to fit that mechanism. Usually, I do it the other way around.

This year, I used a combination of a parallelogram and Vs in a 90&deg; pop-up.  I got the idea when looking through a 1961 Hansel and Gretel pop-up book, which used a similar mechanism throughout the book. Here's the last page from it.

The table in the center is a parallelogram and the two beds are truncated V folds. Not too complicated, and in the book there are no pasted on pieces.

For the May card, I thought, what situation might be used in that mechanism where it is symmetrical and came up with chess players. The players would be on the Vs and the board would be on the parallelogram. I thought playing chess in a park would make a nice scene. When doing my first sketch using mice as players, I found there was a large empty area in front of the players, so I came up with multiple, progressively smaller chess games to fill the space. I changed it up and decided to use the man from the 2015 series of cards as the largest players, then the mischievous kittens from 2018, and then the mice.

## Design

## May Card-specific

The chess board was the trickiest part of this card. Like the table, the pieces are lifted with a parallelogram. I took a mate-in-two chess problem that didn't have too many pieces, and cut slots for each piece on a printed chess board. One thing I forgot was that I intended for the white player to have a piece in hand, so there is an extra pawn in this game.

After cutting the slots, I had to cut holes in the table, which can be bigger than the slots since they'll be hidden by the board.

The piece that will lift all the pieces took a couple tries. The final one is on the left below. Although not clear in the photo, the supports for the pieces closer to the back are longer which avoids getting all seven of them through the base at once. I could to the longest one, then move to the next shorter one, and so on. The far right photo shows all the supports before trimming them to their final length.

*Assembling the chess board*{: .image-caption}

Here's a photo of the completed chess board in which you can see the supports under the pieces. As the card closes, the pieces lean forward and flat. (Since I attached the pieces while the board was on its side, a couple of the pieces are swapped, which everyone will notice as they try to solve the problem.)

The kitten and mice games are with a parallelogram attached to the table leg of the larger game, which also is the support for the board. Since one of the kittens is a naughty kitten, their board is in two pieces, on either side of the chess pieces being tossed around.

For the mice's flat, printed board, I used representation of the chess such as appear in print. It, too, is a mate-in-two chess problem, making the card have three: the cover, the largest game, and the smallest game.

## Covers

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The May cover is a printed chess problem.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The May cover is heavy Bienfeng Sketch paper, and the interior and most of the mechanism are index paper. The smaller pieces are copy paper.
- The chess pieces were cut with the {{ site.cameo }}, all the rest by hand.
