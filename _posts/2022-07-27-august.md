August 2022 card.

## Idea

I was looking through Paul Johnson's [New Pop-Up Paper Projects](/books.html#new-pop-up-paper-projects) book, and he had an "Angled Pop-ups" lesson that looked interesting, so I tried it out. I played around with the design and come up with a variation, which I thought had a unique top-to-bottom twisting motion. That was the mechanism I decided to use as the basis for this card.

Once again, I had a mechanism looking for a subject. How about starting a series? Last month was black and white triangles, so I tried different black and white patterns before finalizing on squares (or diamonds if you prefer).

## Design

The mechanism is cut from one piece of paper with four nested Vs folds, each one progressively smaller. This front view shows the largest, black V pointing up and to the left. A reverse fold (Origami term) in white is the second V that has a black diamond (V fold) pointing forwards. And finally on that is the white and red diamond (V fold) that points up, like the first V. The high-contrast pattern makes it a bit difficult to see in a static photo. You can view the animation above in a new tab by clicking it, or [here](/images/2208/22august.gif){:target="_blank"})

Here's the top view showing the entire pattern all nicely lined up. I say this is a 180&deg; card, but really it's more like 160&deg; since the second diamond prevents it from opening all the way. At 90&deg; it the middle diamond isn't horizontal.

I used [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 100lb for the main mechanism thinking I wanted stiff card for the narrow outer V fold, but I think it was a bit too stiff. Since this is one piece, there's an empty square under the center mechanism. To fill that, I put the main card inside a piece of lighter cardstock, with squares printed in its center.

While writing this blog and reviewing the photos, I see I forgot to fold up two smaller Vs on the top and bottom of the card. But it's 700 miles away now, so a fix will have to wait.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

Like [last month's card](/2022/06/26/july.html), the cover is some of Howard the Younger's pre-school artwork with a triangle added to it.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The pattern was printed on [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 100lb, then cut by hand.
- Paper was used for the third square, which is on the back, as well as the red triangle.
- The outer layer is Michael's 80lb cardstock.
