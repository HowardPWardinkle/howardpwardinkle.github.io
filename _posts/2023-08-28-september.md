## Idea

When I was young I had a storybook about the Bremen Town Musicians. It told the story of four animals who, after being considered useless, were driven away by their owners. A donkey begins the tale, and it meets first a dog, a cat, and finally a rooster. They decide to go to Bremen to become musicians. On the way, they come across a house occupied by robbers. To scare the robbers away so they can get some food and shelter, they stand on each other's backs and make "music", which is so awful that it scares the robbers away.

## Design

I had played around with some ideas for the musicians a few months before and shelved them. This month I revived it and decided to use a mechanism I've seen Robert Sabuda use, but I haven't seen it in any of the how-to-books. It is two identical acute V folds, one behind the other. The rear fold is used to pivot a mechanism near the top of the front fold. By using this technique, you can get a mechanism that can nearly double in size as the card opens. Looking at my archives, I have used this mechanism before, exactly six years ago, in my September 2017 Pop-Up (before I started blogging) based on a Shel Silverstein poem "Alphabalance". Here's a picture of it:

![Alphabalance]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2309/alphabalance.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }

The Z and E are pivots that raise all the letters above them.

This month's card the donkey's back is the pivot point and the other animals rotate from behind the donkey to sit on its back. I was initially going to try making the other animals also pivot, but that got very complicated, so I decided to have the top three be one piece. By using different colors of card for each animal, it still gives a nice effect of stacking the animals.

Here's a picture of the mechanism from behind:

![Back]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2309/back.jpg){: width="{{ site.imageWidthHalf }}" }

Notice that the donkey's V points to the front of the card, but the others point to the back since they fold downward. Unlike in Alphabalance, I didn’t use a solid V behind the other one, instead, I used two vertical pieces to rotate the dog and others up as the donkey rises. Getting the location of the fold at the dog's feet was the trickiest part of the design. If too big, the dog wouldn't stand up straight. If too small, the vertical piece would bend sharply, and try to lift the donkey off the base.

I was a bit worried about just using the donkey's legs attached to the base, fearing that the thin legs wouldn't be strong enough to lift the entire mechanism. Instead, I left the area under the donkey solid and used a piece of paper the same color as the base to define the legs. I'm not 100% happy with the result, and if I had more time I would have tried some more sketches. Time was also a factor in the simplicity of the design. I could have colored the animals, but 1) that takes time and 2) that takes talent (I can only draw mice).

To finish off the base, I printed some text from the story on a couple of pieces of card, folded them, and pasted them on. The fold never wants to stay flat, so it gave a nice 3D effect.

## Cover

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

The cover is a Google map from the arbitrarily picked city of Ovelgönne to Bremen, Germany. I updating the walking figure to be a donkey.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The base was [Strathmore 300 Bristol](/supplies.html#strathmore-300-bristol) 100lb
- The other pieces are mostly cardstock from Michaels.
