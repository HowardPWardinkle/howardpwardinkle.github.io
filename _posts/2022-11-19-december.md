## Ideas

December (well, actually November) is a busy time for making pop-ups. I have the December card, a birthday, and the Christmas card.

In the [Kirigami book](/books.html#kirigami-the-art-of-3-dimensional-paper-cutting) I own has an example of an pop-up advent calendar, to I thought I'd try one of those for the December card. I didn't use the model from the book, but created my own inspired by that one. It took a while to come up with 24 different models (the book repeated some).

For the birthday card, I decided that the mice would be constructing the words "Happy Birthday" out of letters much larger than themselves.

Finally, for this year's (my eleventh) pop-up Christmas card, I discovered I had not done a reindeer yet, so went with that idea.

## December Advent Card Design

I started with the design I wanted for the calendar itself, which you can see in the [covers](#covers) below. I think looks very nice, but there's a catch. I printed it out and then had the machine cut the door, and the "Merry Christmas" text at the top. A red card behind the top gives the text its color since printing red on green paper wouldn't have worked.

For the models to fit on ones page, they require a space at least double the size of the door. The design of my doors are very close, but it's a catch, not a problem. To solve the problem, I just had to make 24 separate models and attach each behind a door. Here's laying out the models over the doors.

Each of the models is a Kirigami (or Origami Architecture) model meaning that it's just a cut out. No pasting pieces on. I created all the models in the computer and had the machine cut them out. I had about six that had to be recut. Some were design errors, and some the model didn't cut cleanly. Initially I was going to use just white, but some of the models didn't look very good, so I ended up putting color on all (except the snowflake).

I thought the models and doors were shaped identically, but when attaching them, I had to trim here and there.

With the added thickness behind the door, they don't want to stay closed, even with spacers behind the non-door areas. I used a tacky, but temporary glue to hold them closed (and hope they'll open nicely).

### Birthday Card Design

This is another origami architecture (OA or `BT5`) design like last [month's](/2022/10/29/november.html) so not much new to say. There are two main levels, HAPPY and BIRTHDAY. Each level then has two letters that are a bit closer than the others to make it a bit more interesting.

Unlike the other two cards for December, this card was totally cut by hand.

### Christmas Card Design


## Covers

![Cover]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.cover}}){: width="{{ site.coverWidth }}" }

This is the base card, with some illustrations on copy paper cut out and applied to it.

## Build

- 9" x 6"
- The base and mechanism are on Michael's cardstock, which is quite a bit lighter than the usual Bristol paper I usually use for the base, but it turned out fine
- The mechanism was cut by the {{ site.cameo }} machine.
- The cover illustrations were done using [PrismaColor pencils](/supplies.html#prismacolor-colored-pencils) and [Pitt Artist Pens](/supplies.html#faber-castell-pitt-artist-pens)
